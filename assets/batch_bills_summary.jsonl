For a period of 2 years after the date of commencement of any\n\n5 provision of this Act, the Minister may, by regulations, prescribe any\n## provision of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of that provision that the Minister may consider necessary or expedient.\n\n EXPLANATORY STATEMENT\n\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Workplace Fairness Act 2025 to provide for\nmediation of workplace fairness disputes and to provide for civil actions for a\nstatutory tort of discrimination.\n\nThe Bill also makes consequential and related amendments to the Employment\nClaims Act 2016, the Industrial Relations Act 1960 and the Retirement and\nRe‑employment Act 1993.\n\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\n\nPART 1\n\nAMENDMENT OF WORKPLACE FAIRNESS ACT 2025\n\nPart 1 (comprising clauses 2 to 8) amends the Workplace Fairness Act 2025.\n\nClause 2 amends section 2 to introduce new definitions and amend certain\ndefinitions. Examples of the new definitions are set out below.\n\nAn “action for discrimination” is defined as a civil action brought under\nsection 36A against an employer for a statutory tort of discrimination.\n\n“Approved mediator” refers to an individual approved by the Commissioner\nfor Workplace Fairness (the “Commissioner”) as a mediator for a mediation of a\nworkplace fairness dispute.\n\n“Claimant”, for the purposes of new Division 2 of Part 7A (provisions relating\nto mediation and settlement of workplace fairness disputes, inserted by clause 3),\nincludes an individual who intends to bring an action for discrimination.\n\nThe terms “mediation”, “mediation request” and “mediation session” are\ndefined. They are used in relation to mediation under the Act.\n\n\n-----\n\n41\n\n“Tribunal limit” is defined as the District Court limit or any other amount\nprescribed in substitution thereof. This is the jurisdiction limit of an Employment\nClaims Tribunal.\n\n“Workplace fairness dispute” is defined as a dispute between an employer and\nan employee or other individual arising from an alleged discriminatory\nemployment decision mentioned in section 17(1). Section 17(1) refers to an\nemployment decision which is defined in section 2 as an employment decision\nmentioned in section 5, 6 or 7.\n\nClause 3 amends section 5 to provide for certain circumstances under which an\nemployer is presumed to have decided not to hire an individual, and the\ncorresponding dates on which the employer is deemed to have given notice of the\ndecision to the individual.\n\nClause 4 inserts new Part 7A (Dispute Resolution) comprising new\nsections 36A to 36R, divided into 4 Divisions.\n\nDivision 1 of Part 7A comprises sections 36A to 36C and deals with civil\nactions.\n\nNew section 36A provides that a civil action (an action for discrimination) may\nbe brought in respect of a newly created statutory tort of discrimination by an\nindividual who is the subject of an alleged discriminatory employment decision\nmade by an employer under section 17(1) (Discrimination against individuals).\nAn action for discrimination may only be brought in the General Division of the\nHigh Court or an Employment Claims Tribunal. The action must, in the first\ninstance, be brought in an Employment Claims Tribunal (if the amount claimed in\nthe action does not exceed the tribunal limit) or the General Division of the High\nCourt (if the amount claimed in the action exceeds the tribunal limit).\n\nNew section 36B provides for the jurisdiction of, and procedure in, the General\nDivision of the High Court in respect of an action for discrimination.\n\nNew section 36C provides for the jurisdiction of, and procedure in, the\nEmployment Claims Tribunal in respect of an action for discrimination.\n\nDivision 2 of Part 7A comprises sections 36D to 36K and deals with mediation\nand settlement of workplace fairness disputes.\n\nNew section 36D requires an employee or individual who intends to bring an\naction for discrimination against an employer (respondent) for any workplace\nfairness dispute to first submit to the Commissioner a request to mediate every\nsuch dispute for which the action for discrimination is intended to be brought\n(mediation request).\n\nNew section 36E provides for the manner and time of submission of, and\ncertain other requirements to be satisfied in relation to, a mediation request.\n\n\n-----\n\n42\n\nSection 36E(2), (3) and (4) sets out the periods of time within which mediation\nrequests for workplace fairness disputes must be made. For example, under\nsubsection (2), a mediation request to mediate a pre‑employment workplace\nfairness dispute must be made within one month after the date on which the\nemployer gives notice of the employment decision to the employee (which may be\ndeemed notice under section 5(4)) or (if no notice is given) within 2 months of the\ndate of the employment decision.\n\nUnder section 36E(5), any claim stated in a mediation request in relation to a\npre‑employment discriminatory decision must not exceed the amount prescribed\nfor the purposes of new section 36N(2)(a). This amount is the limit in the General\nDivision of the High Court for claims arising from pre‑employment\ndiscriminatory decisions. The same amount is intended to be prescribed under\nnew section 12A(7) of the Employment Claims Act 2016 (inserted by clause 14)\nas the limit in an Employment Claims Tribunal for claims arising from\npre‑employment discriminatory decisions.\n\nNew section 36F provides for powers of the Commissioner in relation to\naccepting or refusing to accept mediation requests, and in relation to the fees for\nmediation requests (such as to waive, remit or refund such a fee). Upon accepting\na mediation request, the Commissioner must refer every workplace fairness\ndispute listed in the request to an approved mediator for mediation.\n\nNew section 36G sets out the matters relating to mediation requests for which\nthe Minister is empowered to make regulations under section 44.\n\nNew section 36H provides for certain matters concerning the conduct of a\nmediation session for a workplace fairness dispute. Each mediation session must\nbe held in private. However, an approved mediator may do the following:\n\n(a) in certain circumstances, conduct the mediation sessions for mediation\nrequests by different claimants against the same respondent, or for 2 or\nmore mediation requests by a claimant against one or more\nrespondents, together at the same time and place;\n\n(b) permit a tripartite mediation advisor to assist at a mediation session.\n\nNew section 36I provides for certain matters concerning the representation of a\nparty at a mediation under the new Part 7A. Generally, a party must act in person at\nthe mediation. However, a body corporate may be represented by an officer, or a\nfull‑time employee, of the body corporate; a partnership may be represented by a\npartner, or a full‑time employee, of the partnership; and an unincorporated\nassociation may be represented by a member of the governing body, or a full‑time\nemployee, of the unincorporated association. Regulations made under section 44\nmay also prescribe any other individuals who may represent a party at a mediation\nunder Part 7A. A party may also be represented by an advocate and solicitor if the\nmediation request in relation to the mediation states a claim for an amount\nexceeding the tribunal limit.\n\n\n-----\n\n43\n\nNew section 36J provides for the registration by the General Division of the\nHigh Court or a District Court of a settlement agreement reached through a\nmediation under the new Part 7A; the effects of any such registration; and the\nrefusal to register, or setting aside of any such settlement agreement, by the\nGeneral Division of the High Court or a District Court, as the case may be.\n\nThe procedures are different as between the General Division of the High\nCourt and a District Court.\n\nIn the General Division of the High Court, the court hearing the application for\nregistration of a settlement agreement may register the settlement agreement, or\nrefuse to register the settlement agreement if any condition in section 36J(9) is\nsatisfied. There is no provision for settlement agreements registered in the General\nDivision of the High Court to be set aside. This procedure may be compared to the\nprocedure for recording of mediated settlement agreements under section 12 of the\nMediation Act 2017.\n\nIn a District Court, the court hearing the application for registration of a\nsettlement agreement may register the settlement agreement, or refuse to register\nthe settlement agreement if the application is not made within the prescribed\nperiod. A party to a settlement agreement registered in a District Court may apply\nto set aside the settlement agreement, and the District Court may do so if any\ncondition in section 36J(9) is satisfied. This procedure may be compared to the\nprocedure for registration of settlement agreements under section 7 of the\nEmployment Claims Act 2016.\n\nThe section also —\n\n(a) enables the General Division of the High Court (when hearing an\napplication to register a settlement agreement) or a District Court\n(when hearing an application to set aside the registration of a\nsettlement agreement) to refer any workplace fairness dispute\npurportedly resolved by the settlement agreement to an approved\nmediator for mediation; and\n\n(b) provides for the circumstances in which an approved mediator will\nissue to a claimant a claim referral certificate in respect of any\nworkplace fairness dispute referred by the General Division of the\nHigh Court or a District Court, as the case may be.\n\nNew section 36K provides for the circumstances in which an approved\nmediator will issue, to a claimant, a claim referral certificate in respect of any\nworkplace fairness dispute listed in a mediation request.\n\nDivision 3 of Part 7A comprises sections 36L and 36M and deals with certain\nrestrictions on actions for discrimination and related proceedings.\n\nNew section 36L prevents an action for discrimination in which the alleged\ndiscriminatory employment decision is the dismissal of, or denial of\n\n\n-----\n\n44\n\nre‑employment to, an employee on the ground of a protected characteristic from\nbeing brought, if there are any proceedings before any other forum (such as any\ncourt, an Industrial Arbitration Court or a Minister) relating to the same dismissal\nor denial of re‑employment on the same ground.\n\nNew section 36M prevents proceedings relating to the dismissal of an\nemployee on the ground of a protected characteristic from being brought in any\nother forum (such as any court or an Industrial Arbitration Court), if an action for\ndiscrimination in which the alleged discriminatory employment decision is the\nsame dismissal on the same ground has been brought in the General Division of\nthe High Court or an Employment Claims Tribunal.\n\nDivision 4 of Part 7A comprises sections 36N to 36R and deals with certain\nmatters concerning proceedings in the General Division of the High Court.\n\nNew section 36N provides for the requirements in relation to a claim in the\nGeneral Division of the High Court in any action for discrimination and the\npowers of the court in such an action.\n\nThe section specifies the employees and individuals who may make a claim in\nthe General Division of the High Court in any action for discrimination and the\nrespective employers against whom the claim may be made.\n\nIn addition, a claim must be —\n\n(a) for damages or, in the case of an alleged discriminatory employment\ndecision mentioned in section 7(1), for either damages or reinstatement\nof the claimant in the claimant’s former employment;\n\n(b) accompanied by a claim referral certificate; and\n\n(c) made within the prescribed period after the date of issue of the claim\nreferral certificate, although the General Division of the High Court\nmay accept a claim made after this period if satisfied that there is\nreasonable excuse for the delay.\n\nUnder section 36N(2)(a), if the alleged discriminatory employment decision is\na decision mentioned in section 5(1), the damages claimed must not exceed the\nrelevant prescribed amount. This amount is the limit in the General Division of the\nHigh Court for claims arising from pre‑employment discriminatory decisions. The\nsame amount is intended to be prescribed under new section 12A(8)(a)(i) of the\nEmployment Claims Act 2016 (inserted by clause 14) as the limit in an\nEmployment Claims Tribunal for claims arising from pre‑employment\ndiscriminatory decisions.\n\nIn an action for discrimination, the General Division of the High Court may\naward damages to the claimant or order reinstatement of the claimant in the\nclaimant’s former employment if the court is satisfied on the balance of\n\n\n-----\n\n45\n\nprobabilities that the employer has committed the statutory tort of discrimination\nagainst the claimant.\n\nNew section 36O provides for proceedings before the General Division of the\nHigh Court to be conducted in private. However, the court may permit certain\nindividuals to observe proceedings before the court.\n\nNew section 36P deals with the conduct of, and evidence in, proceedings\nbefore the General Division of the High Court. Among other things, the court will\nadopt a “judge‑led approach” by identifying the relevant issues and ensuring that\nthe relevant evidence is adduced by the parties. The court may, on its own\ninitiative, seek such other evidence and make such other investigations and\ninquiries as the court thinks fit in any proceedings under the Act.\n\nNew section 36Q provides that a party to a claim in an action for discrimination\nbefore the General Division of the High Court may appeal against an award or\norder made by the court under new section 36N(5) on certain specified grounds,\nbut only if permission to appeal is given by the General Division of the High\nCourt.\n\nNew section 36R empowers the Rules Committee appointed under\nsection 80(3) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 to make Rules of\nCourt regulating the practice and procedure of the Court of Appeal, the Appellate\nDivision of the High Court, the General Division of the High Court and the\nDistrict Court in respect of any matter under the Act.\n\nClause 5 amends section 41 to void any term of a contract of service or\ncollective agreement that precludes any person from bringing an action for\ndiscrimination, submitting a mediation request, making a complaint or allegation,\nraising a grievance, or appealing against any decision of a court or authorised\nofficer, under the Act.\n\nClause 6 makes consequential amendments to section 44 arising from new\nsections 36N(2)(a) and 36R.\n\nClause 7 inserts new sections 45 to 48.\n\nNew section 45 deals with the disclosure and publication of certain\ninformation. In certain circumstances, the Commissioner, an approved\nmediator, the General Division of the High Court or the Registrar of the\nSupreme Court may disclose information relating to a mediation request, a\nmediation under Division 2 of new Part 7A or an action for discrimination. The\nGeneral Division of the High Court or the Registrar of the Supreme Court may\nalso publish information relating to an award, order or decision of the General\nDivision of the High Court.\n\nNew section 46 protects an approved mediator from personal liability for acts\nor omissions in the execution or purported execution of the Act.\n\n\n-----\n\n46\n\nNew section 47 deems every approved mediator carrying out the functions and\nduties of an approved mediator, and every authorised person carrying out any\nfunction or duty of the Commissioner under the Act, to be a public servant for the\npurposes of the Penal Code 1871.\n\nNew section 48 states that nothing in the Act (other than section 34 and new\nsection 36A) is to be construed as conferring a right of action in any civil\nproceedings in respect of any contravention of any provisions of the Act or a\ndefence to an action in any civil proceedings or as otherwise affecting a right of\naction in any civil proceedings.\n\nClause 8 renumbers the existing sections 45 and 46 of the Act as sections 49\nand 50, respectively.\n\nPART 2\n\nCONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED AMENDMENTS\nTO EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS ACT 2016\n\nPart 2 (comprising clauses 9 to 21) makes consequential and related\namendments to the Employment Claims Act 2016.\n\nClause 9 amends section 2(1) to introduce definitions of “action for\ndiscrimination”, “District Judge”, “Magistrate” and “workplace fairness\ndispute” and amend the definition of “claim referral certificate”.\n\nClause 10 amends section 3(3)(a)(iii) to correct a syntactical error. No change\nin meaning is intended.\n\nClause 11 amends section 7 to extend the application of that section to the\nsettlement of a workplace fairness dispute reached through a tripartite mediation\nconducted by an approved mediator under new section 36H of the Workplace\nFairness Act 2025 (inserted by clause 4).\n\nClause 12 amends section 9(5) to allow the designation of a Magistrate (within\nthe meaning of the State Courts Act 1970) as a tribunal magistrate.\n\nClause 13 amends section 12 to provide that that section does not apply to or in\nrelation to any claim involving a workplace fairness dispute. Claims relating to\nworkplace fairness disputes are dealt with under new section 12A (inserted by\nclause 14).\n\nClause 14 inserts new section 12A, in relation to claims under the Workplace\nFairness Act 2025. Section 12A provides for —\n\n(a) the requirements which must be satisfied before a tribunal has\njurisdiction to hear and determine such a claim; and\n\n(b) the employees and individuals who may make a claim and the\nrespective employers against whom the claim may be made.\n\n\n-----\n\n47\n\nIn addition, a claim must be —\n\n(a) for damages (not exceeding the relevant prescribed amount) or, in the\ncase of an alleged discriminatory employment decision mentioned in\nsection 7(1) of the Workplace Fairness Act 2025, either damages or\nreinstatement of the claimant in the claimant’s former employment;\n\n(b) accompanied by a claim referral certificate; and\n\n(c) lodged within the prescribed period after the date of issue of the claim\nreferral certificate, although an Employment Claims Tribunal may\naccept a claim lodged after this period if satisfied that there is\nreasonable excuse for the delay.\n\nUnder new section 12A(7), the amount of damages claimed in an Employment\nClaims Tribunal must not exceed an amount prescribed for the purposes of this\nsubsection. The prescribed amount for claims arising from pre‑employment\ndiscriminatory decisions is intended to be the same as the amount prescribed under\nnew section 36N(2)(a) (inserted by clause 4) as the limit in the General Division of\nthe High Court.\n\nClause 15 makes consequential amendments to section 13(2)(b)(i) arising from\nnew section 12A (inserted by clause 14).\n\nClause 16 makes consequential amendments to section 15 arising from new\nsection 12A (inserted by clause 14).\n\nClause 17 amends section 17 to provide that transfers under that section may be\nmade on the motion of the appropriate court, and to provide for the transfer, by the\nGeneral Division of the High Court, of proceedings in an action for discrimination\nbefore an Employment Claims Tribunal to the General Division of the High Court.\n\nClause 18 inserts new section 17A to provide for the transfer, by an\nEmployment Claims Tribunal, of proceedings in the tribunal to another court.\n\nClause 19 amends section 22 to provide that the amount of money that an\nEmployment Claims Tribunal orders to be paid in an action for discrimination\nmust not exceed the prescribed claims limit in new section 12A(7). The clause also\nmakes consequential amendments to section 22 arising from new section 12A.\n\nClause 20 amends section 29 to provide that a tribunal magistrate or Registrar\nfor the tribunals may disclose information relating to claims and proceedings\nunder the Workplace Fairness Act 2025 for certain purposes, including\ninvestigations into civil contraventions and serious civil contraventions under\nthe Workplace Fairness Act 2025.\n\nClause 21 amends section 33 to provide that Rules of Court made under that\nsection may prescribe a different claim limit, procedure or practice for each of the\nspecified classes of Employment Claims Tribunals.\n\n\n-----\n\n48\n\nPART 3\n\nCONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED AMENDMENTS\nTO INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ACT 1960\n\nPart 3 (comprising clauses 22 to 29) makes consequential and related\namendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1960.\n\nClause 22 amends section 2 to introduce definitions of “District Court limit”,\n“tribunal limit” and “workplace fairness dispute”.\n\nClauses 23 and 26 replace section 30(1) and amend section 30F, respectively, to\nintroduce a definition of “employer” (within the meaning of section 2 of the\nWorkplace Fairness Act 2025), in relation to workplace fairness disputes.\n\nClause 24 amends section 30A(1) to extend the areas where rank and file trade\nunions can represent executive employees on an individual basis to include\nworkplace fairness disputes.\n\nClause 25 makes a consequential amendment to section 30B(a) arising from\nthe amendments to section 30A(1) by clause 24.\n\nClause 27 amends section 30G to extend the types of disputes that may be the\nsubject of tripartite mediation to include workplace fairness disputes generally.\nHowever, in certain circumstances, a workplace fairness dispute may not be the\nsubject of tripartite mediation (for example, if the notification under\nsection 30H(2) in relation to the workplace fairness dispute is received by the\nCommissioner after the applicable period for the submission of a mediation\nrequest in relation to that dispute under new section 36E of the Workplace Fairness\nAct 2025 (inserted by clause 4)).\n\nClause 28 amends section 30H to support the amendments to section 30G (by\nclause 27).\n\nClause 29 amends section 35 to replace subsection (9) and introduce a\nsupporting definition of “action for discrimination”.

or\n\n(b) require a director of a company to provide any information, book or\ndocument or a copy or an extract thereof that is in the possession,\nwithin the knowledge, or in the custody or under the control, of the\ncompany,\n\nby the time, in the form and manner, and at the place specified in the order.\n\nClause 2 also amends section 39 by inserting new subsections (1A), (1B)\nand (7) to support the new power to issue the written order as described above.\n\nThe new subsection (1A) provides that the power to issue the written order\nincludes other ancillary powers, such as the power to order a person to produce or\ngrant access to, or provide an explanation of, the information, book, document,\ncopy or extract.\n\nThe new subsection (1B) enables an officer or employee of the Authority to\n(without payment) keep any information, book or document, or any copy or\nextract thereof, that is provided to him or her pursuant to the written order.\n\nThe new subsection (7) protects a person against personal liability if the\nperson, in good faith and with reasonable care, does or omits to do anything in\ncomplying with the written order.\n\nClause 3 amends section 42(1) to enable a member, officer, employee,\nconsultant or agent, or a member of a committee, of the Authority to disclose any\ninformation relating to the affairs of the Authority or of any other person which\nhas been obtained by the firstmentioned person in the performance of his or her\nduties or the exercise of his or her functions, if such disclosure is made for the\npurpose of providing any information under an arrangement between the\nAuthority and a foreign audit regulator to which section 59B of the\nAccountants Act 2004 applies. The new section 59B is inserted in the\nAccountants Act 2004 under clause 32.\n\nPART 2\n\nAMENDMENT OF\nACCOUNTANTS ACT 2004\n\nPart 2 comprises clauses 4 to 37. Clauses 4 to 36 amend the Accountants\nAct 2004 (Accountants Act). Clause 37 contains saving and transitional\nprovisions for the amendments to the Accountants Act.\n\nClause 4 amends section 2(1) to insert definitions for “accounting entity”,\n“constitution”, “individual practitioner” and “proliferation financing”.\n\n\n-----\n\n96\n\nThe definitions of “accounting entity” and “individual practitioner” are the\nsame as those in the existing section 38B, and have been moved to section 2(1)\nbecause the 2 terms are used in section 28(1)(b) (as amended under clause 21).\n\nThe definition of “constitution” is inserted into section 2(1) because the term is\nused in sections 17 and 26 (as amended under clauses 16 and 20 respectively).\n\nThe definition of “proliferation financing” is inserted into section 2(1) because\nthe term is used in sections 5(1), 38B and 64(2) and (3) (as amended under\nclauses 5, 23 and 33, respectively).\n\nClause 4 also makes a consequential amendment to section 2(3) arising from\nthe amendment of section 15 under clause 15.\n\nClause 5 amends section 5(1) to expand the Oversight Committee’s functions\nto include —\n\n(a) considering all applications for registration or renewal of registration\nreferred by the Registrar of Public Accountants (called in this Part the\nRegistrar) under the new sections 11 and 13 (inserted under clauses 10\nand 12 respectively);\n\n(b) assisting the Authority to determine, prescribe, issue, adopt and review\nthe requirements to be applied by public accountants and accounting\nentities for the detection and prevention of proliferation financing and\nthe recording and reporting of transactions suspected of involving\nproliferation financing; and\n\n(c) administering programmes to review the compliance by public\naccountants and accounting entities with the requirements for the\ndetection and prevention of proliferation financing.\n\nClause 6 amends section 8(2) to replace the duty of the Registrar to allow a\nperson to inspect various registers kept by the Registrar, with the duty to allow a\nperson, at the person’s request, access to any such register by obtaining a copy of\nor extract from it.\n\nClauses 7, 8 and 9 make consequential amendments to sections 8A, 8B and 8C\nrespectively, arising from the amendment of section 8 under clause 6. Clause 7\nalso replaces the term “commencement date” in section 8Awith 9 December 2024\n(the date of commencement of section 14 of the ACRA (Registry and Regulatory\nEnhancements) Act 2024), and deletes section 8A(4) as the definition of\n“individual practitioner” is inserted in section 2(1) under clause 4.\n\nClause 10 replaces sections 10 and 11.\n\nThe new section 10 replaces the existing section 10 which sets out\nrequirements for an individual who wishes to be registered as a public\naccountant. The new section 10 includes a new requirement that the individual\nmust be registered or deemed to be registered as a chartered accountant under\n\n\n-----\n\n97\n\nPart 6B of the ACRA Act and his or her registration is not suspended under that\nPart. The new section 10 also allows registration requirements that relate to\ncontinuing professional education or other professional courses or training to be\nprescribed, and enables the Oversight Committee (and not, as per the existing\nsection 10(2), the Authority) to exempt an applicant from certain registration\nrequirements, if the Oversight Committee is satisfied that the applicant is\notherwise fit to practise as a public accountant.\n\nThe new section 11 replaces the existing section 11 which sets out certain\nmatters relating to an application for registration as a public accountant. The\napplication must be made to the Registrar (and not, as per the existing\nsection 11(1), the Oversight Committee). The Registrar (and not, as per the\nexisting section 11(4), the Oversight Committee) may require an applicant to\nundergo any interview that the Registrar considers necessary for a proper\nconsideration of the application.\n\nThe new section 11 also sets out the circumstances in which the Registrar may\nregister an applicant as a public accountant, and the circumstances in which the\nRegistrar must refer an application to the Oversight Committee for its decision on\nwhether the applicant may be registered as a public accountant. In addition, the\nnew section 11 sets out the validity period for every registration of an applicant as\na public accountant, and provides an avenue for appeal to the Minister by an\napplicant who is aggrieved by a direction of the Oversight Committee to the\nRegistrar to refuse to register the applicant.\n\nClause 11 amends section 12(2) to enable the Registrar (and not, as per the\nexisting section 12(2), the Oversight Committee) to determine the form and\nmanner of a certificate of registration that is issued to an applicant who is\nregistered as a public accountant.\n\nClause 12 replaces section 13 and inserts new section 13A.\n\nThe new section 13 provides that an application to renew a public accountant’s\nregistration as a public accountant must be made to the Registrar (and not, as per\nthe existing section 13(1), the Oversight Committee), and sets out the\nrequirements that a public accountant must satisfy, including a new requirement\nthat the individual must be registered or deemed to be registered as a chartered\naccountant under Part 6B of the ACRA Act and that registration is not suspended\nunder that Part.\n\nThe new section 13 also allows for renewal requirements that relate to\nprofessional courses or training (in addition to continuing professional education)\nand membership in any professional accountancy body or organisation to be\nprescribed, and enables the Oversight Committee to exempt an applicant from\ncertain renewal requirements, if the Oversight Committee is satisfied that the\napplicant is otherwise fit to practise as a public accountant.\n\n\n-----\n\n98\n\nThe new section 13 also sets out certain matters relating to an application for\nthe renewal of the applicant’s registration as a public accountant. It also sets out\nthe circumstances in which the Registrar may renew the registration of a public\naccountant, and the circumstances in which the Registrar must refer an application\nto the Oversight Committee for its decision on whether the registration of the\napplicant as a public accountant may be renewed.\n\nNext, the new section 13 sets out the validity period for every renewal of\nregistration of an applicant as a public accountant.\n\nLastly, the new section 13 also provides an avenue for appeal to the Minister by\nan applicant who is aggrieved by a direction of the Oversight Committee to the\nRegistrar to refuse to renew the applicant’s registration as a public accountant.\n\nThe new section 13A provides that in directing the Registrar to register an\napplicant, or renew the registration of an applicant, as a public accountant, the\nOversight Committee may impose any condition that the Oversight Committee\nthinks fit. The Oversight Committee may also modify, remove or add conditions\nafter observing the requisite process in the new section 13A.\n\nClause 13 amends section 14 to shorten the period (from 30 days to 14 days)\nwithin which a public accountant must notify the Registrar of any change in his or\nher name, residential address, contact address or any other relevant particulars\nrecorded in the Register of Public Accountants.\n\nClause 14 inserts new section 14A to enable the Registrar to (without\ncompensation) cancel the registration of a public accountant upon application by\nthe public accountant to the Registrar. The new section 14A also sets out the\ncircumstances under which the Registrar must not cancel the public accountant’s\nregistration.\n\nClause 15 amends section 15 to —\n\n(a) require the Registrar to remove from the Register of Public\nAccountants (called in this paragraph the register) the name and\nrelevant particulars of any public accountant whose registration is\ncancelled under subsection (4) or the new section 14A;\n\n(b) provide that an individual whose particulars have been removed from\nthe register due to a cancellation of his or her registration under\nsection 15(1)(c), (d) or (e) is still treated as a public accountant for the\npurposes of Part 6 of the Accountants Act if —\n\n(i) before the removal, the Oversight Committee has referred any\ncomplaint or information that may result in any disciplinary\nproceedings against the individual to the Registrar for review;\nor\n\n\n-----\n\n99\n\n(ii) as at the date of the removal, disciplinary proceedings are\npending against the individual;\n\n(c) allow an individual whose particulars have been removed from the\nregister to apply for reinstatement to the register, and require the\nRegistrar to carry out the reinstatement if satisfied that the individual\nhas applied to renew his or her registration which has been granted, and\nhas paid the requisite fee;\n\n(d) make clear that the Oversight Committee may cancel the registration\nof a public accountant under section 15(4) without compensation;\n\n(e) enable the Oversight Committee to cancel the registration of a public\naccountant under section 15(4) without also ordering the removal of\nthe particulars of the public accountant from the register;\n\n(f) introduce the following new grounds upon which the Oversight\nCommittee may cancel the registration of a public accountant:\n\n(i) the public accountant is no longer registered, or deemed to be\nregistered, as a chartered accountant under Part 6B of the\nACRA Act or has had his or her registration as such revoked or\nsuspended under that Part;\n\n(ii) the public accountant ceases to satisfy any of the requirements\nprescribed under the new section 13(1)(b) relating to the\nrenewal of a public accountant’s registration;\n\n(iii) the public accountant has failed to comply with any condition\nof exemption imposed under the new section 10(3) or 13(3) or\nany condition of registration or renewal of registration imposed\nunder the new section 13A(1); and\n\n(g) introduce a new process that must be observed before the Oversight\nCommittee may cancel the registration of a public accountant (X),\nincluding a requirement to give written notice to X, allowing X to make\nwritten representations, and the right of an individual who is aggrieved\nby the Oversight Committee’s decision to cancel his or her registration\nto appeal to the Minister.\n\nClause 16 amends section 17(3). As the Companies Act 1967 refers to the\nconstitution (instead of the articles of association) of a company, clause 16 amends\nsection 17(3)(c) to refer to the constitution of the company or proposed company.\nClause 16 also makes a minor amendment to section 17(3)(e).\n\nClause 17 amends section 18(3) to include, as a requirement for the approval of\na firm or proposed firm as an accounting firm, that the firm or proposed firm be\ncovered by professional indemnity insurance in accordance with section 28 and\nthe prescribed requirements, if any.\n\n\n-----\n\n100\n\nClause 18 makes a minor amendment to section 18A(3)(d).\n\nClause 19 amends section 22(2) to shorten the period (from 30 days to 14 days)\nwithin which a public accountant must notify the Registrar of any change in the\nname or relevant particulars of the accounting entity in which he or she is\npractising, that are recorded in any register that the Registrar maintains under the\nAccountants Act.\n\nClause 20 amends section 26. As the Companies Act 1967 refers to the\nconstitution (instead of the memorandum and articles of association) of a\ncompany, clause 20 amends section 26(1) and (2)(a) to refer to the constitution of\nan accounting corporation. Clause 20 also amends section 26(2) to shorten the\nperiod (from 30 days to 14 days) within which an accounting corporation must\nprovide the Registrar a report on certain changes, including any amendment to its\nconstitution, after the change occurs.\n\nClause 21 amends section 28 to impose on every accounting firm a requirement\nthat it must be covered by professional indemnity insurance that satisfies the\nconditions set out in that section.\n\nClause 22 replaces the Part heading of Part 5A to reflect that the provisions of\nPart 5A that are amended under clauses 23 and 36 relate to the review of\ncompliance by an accounting entity with the requirements to detect and prevent\nproliferation financing, in addition to money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nClause 23 amends section 38B by deleting the definitions of “accounting\nentity” and “individual practitioner”. Definitions of the 2 terms are inserted in\nsection 2(1) under clause 4.\n\nClause 23 also replaces the definitions of “AML/CFT requirements” or\n“Anti‑Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism\nrequirements” and “AML/CFT requirements review” in section 38B with the\nnew definitions of “AML/CFT/CPF requirements” or “Anti‑Money Laundering\nand Countering the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation Financing\nrequirements” and “AML/CFT/CPF requirements review”, because of the\nchange of those terms in sections 38D, 38E, 38F, 38G, 38I, 38J and 38K of the\nAccountants Act (as amended under clause 36).\n\nFurther, clause 23 also makes a consequential amendment to the definition of\n“entity reviewer” arising from the insertion of the definition of “AML/CFT/CPF\nrequirements review”.\n\nClause 24 amends section 41 to insert new subsections (1A) and (3A) and\nreplace subsection (3).\n\nThe new subsection (1A) provides that the Oversight Committee must not refer\nto the Registrar under section 41(1) a complaint relating to a public accountant or\nan accounting entity for review, and must dismiss the complaint, if the complaint\nis made to the Oversight Committee after the specified date, unless the Oversight\n\n\n-----\n\n101\n\nCommittee thinks there are special reasons to refer the complaint to the Registrar\nanyway.

Those provisions provide that the Oversight Committee may\nappoint an advocate and solicitor to prosecute a complaint or act as a legal adviser\nto a Disciplinary Committee for the purpose of a formal inquiry and that the\nDisciplinary Committee may direct the advocate and solicitor to attend a\npre‑hearing conference in relation to the formal inquiry under the new\nsection 51A.\n\nClause 27 inserts new sections 51A and 51B.\n\nThe new section 51A(1) protects the information obtained by a Disciplinary\nCommittee during a formal inquiry, the record of a Disciplinary Committee’s\nproceedings and the report made by a Disciplinary Committee to the Oversight\nCommittee from disclosure to any person except under certain circumstances,\nincluding where the consent of the Oversight Committee has been obtained for the\ndisclosure.\n\nThe new section 51A(2) provides that the protection in the new section 51A(1)\ndoes not prevent a public accountant or an accounting entity from disclosing either\nof the following for the purpose of seeking legal advice or assistance in relation to\nor connected with the disciplinary proceedings concerned, or any appeal or other\nlegal proceedings following the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings:\n\n(a) the whole or any part of any information, written record or report in the\npublic accountant’s or accounting entity’s possession;\n\n(b) any document in the possession of the public accountant or accounting\nentity that the public accountant or accounting entity submitted to the\nDisciplinary Committee for the purposes of the formal inquiry.\n\nThe new section 51B enables the Disciplinary Committee to conduct a\npre‑hearing conference in relation to its formal inquiry into any complaint or\ninformation referred to it.

B may, with A’s consent, use\nor disclose the regulatory information for certain purposes.\n\nThe new section 59B(2), (3) and (4) sets out the manner in which a foreign\naudit regulator may request for regulatory information from the Authority under\nany such arrangement, and the grounds on which the Registrar may grant or refuse\nthe request.\n\nClause 33 amends section 64(2)(g) and (3)(a) to enable the Authority to (with\nthe approval of the Minister) make rules to prescribe the requirements to be\napplied by public accountants and accounting entities in relation to the detection\nand prevention of proliferation financing and the recording and reporting of\ntransactions suspected of involving proliferation financing, including any\nrequirement necessary or expedient to give effect to any recommendation\nissued or adopted by the Financial Action Task Force relating to the prevention of\nproliferation financing.\n\nClause 33 also deletes section 64(6)(b) and (7)(b) so that where any external\nmaterial is adopted by reference in any rules made by the Authority or such\nexternal material is amended, the Authority is not required to give notice in the\n_Gazette stating that the external material, or the external material as amended, is_\navailable for inspection during normal office hours, free of charge, and the place at\nwhich it may be inspected.\n\nClause 34 deletes section 64AA(5)(b) and (6)(b) so that where any external\nmaterial is adopted by reference in an order made by the Oversight Committee\nprescribing a code of professional conduct and ethics for public accountants and\naccounting entities, etc., or such external material is amended, the Oversight\nCommittee is not required to give notice in the Gazette stating that the external\nmaterial, or the external material as amended, is available for inspection during\nnormal office hours, free of charge, and the place at which it may be inspected.\n\nClause 35 makes minor amendments to section 64A arising from the new\nsection 13A inserted under clause 12 and the amendment of section 15 under\nclause 15.\n\nClause 36 amends sections 38D, 38E, 38F, 38G, 38I, 38J and 38K for the\npurpose of imposing on an accounting entity and its individual practitioners\nrequirements to detect and prevent proliferation financing, in addition to money\nlaundering and terrorism financing.\n\n\n-----\n\n106\n\nPART 3\n\nAMENDMENT OF\nCOMPANIES ACT 1967\n\nPart 3 comprises clauses 38 to 105.

The definitions of\n“statutory meeting” and “statutory report” are deleted because of the deletion of\nsection 174 under clause 69. Subsections (3) and (4) are deleted because of the\ndeletion of sections 59 and 60 under clause 46.\n\nClause 39 deletes section 12(2)(a) to remove a person’s ability to inspect any\ndocument or microfilm of any document filed or lodged with the Registrar of\nCompanies (called in this Part the Registrar). This is because the person may\nalready (on payment of the prescribed fee) require a copy of any document or\nextract from any such document kept by the Registrar to be given to that person\nunder section 12(2)(b). The clause also makes consequential amendments to\nsection 12(2AB), (2AC), (2A) and (2B) arising from the deletion of\nsection 12(2)(a).\n\nNext, clause 39 replaces section 12(2)(c) and (d) to remove a person’s ability to\ninspect certain registers kept by the Registrar. The replacement provisions allow a\nperson (on payment of the prescribed fee) to have access to any of those registers\nby obtaining a copy of or an extract from it.\n\nNext, clause 39 amends section 12(2C) by deleting paragraph (a) to remove the\nability of a director, chief executive officer, secretary, auditor or member of a\ncompany to inspect certain registers. This is because they already have a right to\nobtain from the Registrar a copy of or an extract from them without charge under\nsection 12(2C)(b).\n\nLastly, clause 39 amends section 12(2D) by deleting paragraph (a) to remove\nthe ability of a director, chief executive officer, secretary, auditor or member of a\nprivate company to inspect the register of members of the company.

The clause also makes\nconsequential amendments to section 9(3A) and (3B) (as inserted by section 69 of\nthe ACRA (Registry and Regulatory Enhancements) Act 2024) arising from the\ndeletion of section 9(2)(a).\n\nNext, clause 126 replaces section 9(2)(c) to remove a person’s ability to inspect\nany register of directors, managers, secretaries or auditors. The replacement\nprovision allows a person (on payment of the prescribed fee) to have access to any\nsuch register by obtaining a copy of or an extract from it.\n\nFinally, clause 126 replaces section 9(4) to remove the ability of a director,\nmanager, secretary, auditor or member of a VCC or custodian of a non‑umbrella\nVCC or sub‑fund to inspect the register of directors, managers, secretaries or\nauditors of that VCC. This is because they have a right to obtain from the Registrar\na copy of or an extract from that register without charge under the replacement\nprovision.\n\nClause 127 makes a consequential amendment to section 11A(a) (as inserted\nby section 70 of the ACRA (Registry and Regulatory Enhancements) Act 2024)\narising from the amendment of section 12 of the Companies Act under clause 39\nand the deletion of section 9(2)(a) under clause 126.\n\nClause 128 amends section 16(2) to require a person who wishes to incorporate\na VCC to lodge with the Registrar a notice of the situation of the registered office\nof the proposed VCC. This requirement now resides in section 16(2) and not\nsection 143 of the Companies Act (as applied by section 45) because of the\nreplacement of section 143 of the Companies Act under clause 53.\n\n\n-----\n\n125\n\nClause 129 amends section 33A (as inserted by section 30 of the Variable\nCapital Companies (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2019), which deals with the\nprocess for dissolving a defunct sub‑fund, for the following purposes:\n\n(a) shorten the period (from 30 days to 15 days after the date of the\nRegistrar’s letter) within which an umbrella VCC or a director,\nsecretary or member of the umbrella VCC holding shares issued in\nrespect of a sub‑fund may show cause as to why the sub‑fund should\nnot be declared dissolved because the umbrella VCC is not carrying on\nany business in relation to the sub‑fund or the sub‑fund is not in\noperation;\n\n(b) shorten the period for the receipt of an answer to the letter (from\none month to 15 days after the date of the letter) after which the\nRegistrar may proceed to publish in the Gazette and send to the\numbrella VCC a notice to declare the sub‑fund dissolved;\n\n(c) provide that a sub‑fund is considered dissolved on the date and at the\ntime when the Registrar deletes its particulars from the register in\nwhich it is registered under section 27 and not, as per the existing\nsubsection (6), on the publication of a notice in the Gazette of such\ndissolution;\n\n(d) require the notice of the dissolution (which must be published in the\n_Gazette) to state the date and time when the particulars of the sub‑fund_\nhave been deleted from the register, in addition to the dissolution;\n\n(e) require the Registrar to ensure that any person who obtains any\ninformation on the sub‑fund or its umbrella VCC using the Authority’s\nelectronic transaction system is informed that the sub‑fund has been\ndissolved.\n\nClause 130 amends section 33B (as inserted by section 30 of the Variable\nCapital Companies (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2019), which deals with the\nprocess for dissolving a sub‑fund of an umbrella VCC on application by the\numbrella VCC, for the following purposes:\n\n(a) replace the requirement for the Registrar to send to the umbrella VCC\nand its directors, secretaries and members holding shares issued in\nrelation to the sub‑fund a letter informing them of the application and\nstating that a notice of intent to dissolve the sub‑fund will be published\nin the Gazette, with a requirement for the Registrar to send the notice to\nthe umbrella VCC and its directors, secretaries and members holding\nshares issued in relation to the sub‑fund (in addition to publishing it in\nthe Gazette);\n\n(b) provide that a sub‑fund is considered dissolved on the date and at the\ntime when the Registrar deletes its particulars from the register in\n\n\n-----\n\n126\n\nwhich it is registered under section 27 and not, as per the existing\nsubsection (6), on the publication of a notice in the Gazette of such\ndissolution;\n\n(c) require the notice of the dissolution (which must be published in the\n_Gazette) to state the date and time when the particulars of the sub‑fund_\nhave been deleted from the register, in addition to the dissolution;\n\n(d) require the Registrar to ensure that any person who obtains any\ninformation on the sub‑fund or its umbrella VCC using the Authority’s\nelectronic transaction system is informed that the sub‑fund has been\ndissolved.\n\nClause 131 makes a consequential amendment to section 33D(1) (as inserted\nby section 30 of the Variable Capital Companies (Miscellaneous Amendments)\nAct 2019) arising from the amendment of section 33B under clause 130.\n\nClause 132 makes amendments to section 44 that are the same as some of the\namendments to section 44 under section 72 of the ACRA (Registry and\nRegulatory Enhancements) Act 2024. Those amendments under section 72 of\nthe ACRA (Registry and Regulatory Enhancements) Act 2024 are intended to be\nmade under this Bill instead, and section 72 of that Act is deleted under clause 153.\n\nClause 132 also makes a consequential amendment to section 44 arising from\nthe removal of the class of corporations known as “Registered Fund Management\nCompanies” following amendments to the Securities and Futures (Licensing and\nConduct of Business) Regulations.\n\nClause 133 makes a consequential amendment to the section heading of\nsection 45 arising from the replacement of section 143 of the Companies Act\nunder clause 53, which is incorporated by reference in section 45.\n\nClause 134 makes a consequential amendment to section 46(2) arising from the\nremoval of the class of corporations known as “Registered Fund Management\nCompanies” following amendments to the Securities and Futures (Licensing and\nConduct of Business) Regulations.\n\nClause 135 amends section 58(1)(a) to expand the list of offences a person\nconvicted of which would disqualify him or her from acting as a director or taking\npart in the management of a VCC. The new offences are money laundering and\nrelated offences in the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes\n(Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992.\n\nClause 136 makes a consequential amendment to section 65(1)(a) arising from\nthe amendment of section 163 of the Companies Act under clause 59.\n\nClause 137 makes a consequential amendment to section 70 arising from the\namendment of section 172B of the Companies Act under clause 62.\n\n\n-----\n\n127\n\nClause 138 makes consequential amendments to section 72(1) arising from the\namendment of section 173A of the Companies Act under clause 63.\n\nClause 139 makes consequential amendments to section 74 arising from the\namendments of sections 173A and 173E of the Companies Act under clauses 63\nand 66 respectively.\n\nClause 140 amends section 77 to clarify that —\n\n(a) the obligation to hold an annual general meeting of a VCC after the end\nof each financial year of the VCC within the specified period rests with\nthe VCC; and\n\n(b) the offence in subsection (4) applies to a failure to comply with that\nobligation (and not, as per the existing subsection (4), a default in\nholding the annual general meeting), including to hold the annual\ngeneral meeting within the specified period.\n\nClause 141 makes a consequential amendment to section 78(6) arising from the\namendment of section 77 under clause 140.\n\nClause 142 amends the Part heading of Part 7 to reflect that section 84 (as\namended under clause 144) relates to directions and regulations to prevent\nproliferation financing, in addition to money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nClause 143 amends the Division heading of Division 1 of Part 7 to reflect that\nsection 84 (as amended under clause 144) enables the issuance and making of\ndirections and regulations to prevent proliferation financing, in addition to money\nlaundering and terrorism financing.\n\nClause 144 amends section 84 to enable the Monetary Authority of Singapore\nto issue directions or make regulations concerning any VCC or class of VCCs as it\nconsiders necessary for the prevention of proliferation financing.\n\nClause 145 amends section 97(6) to increase the maximum fine for an offence\nin relation to a failure to lodge an annual return, etc., under section 97 from $5,000\nto $10,000.\n\nClause 146 amends section 99(5) to increase the maximum fine for an offence\nin relation to keeping accounting records, etc., under section 99(2) or (3), or\nsection 199(3) or (4) of the Companies Act (as applied by section 99(4)), from\n$5,000 to $10,000.\n\nClause 147 amends section 100 to —\n\n(a) make clear under subsection (9) that the Minister may substitute, for\nVCCs of a specified class or description, the whole or any part of other\naccounting standards for the whole or any part of the Accounting\nStandards; and\n\n\n-----\n\n128\n\n(b) enable the Minister to exempt the directors of any VCC of a specified\nclass or description from having to ensure that its financial statements\nor consolidated financial statements comply with all or any of the\nrequirements of the Accounting Standards.\n\nClause 148 makes consequential amendments to section 109(3) arising from\nthe amendment of section 207 of the Companies Act under clause 78 and the\namendment of section 100 under clause 147.\n\nClause 149 makes a consequential amendment to section 130B(2) (as inserted\nby section 48 of the Variable Capital Companies (Miscellaneous Amendments)\nAct 2019) arising from the amendment of section 344 of the Companies Act under\nclause 81.\n\nClause 150 amends section 148(1)(b) and (2)(d) to increase the composition\namount specified in those provisions from $5,000 to $20,000.\n\nClause 151 amends section 157 (as re‑enacted by section 57 of the Variable\nCapital Companies (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2019) to set out a provision\nthat applies in place of the new section 396A(1B) of the Companies Act (inserted\nunder clause 99).

The provision that applies in place of\nthe new section 396A(1B) of the Companies Act provides that the requirement in\nthe new section 396A(1A) of that Act (as applied by section 157(1)) for a person to\ngive to the VCC reasonable notice of the person’s intent to inspect any VCC\nrecord, does not limit the right conferred on certain persons by the VCC Act to\ninspect or obtain any VCC record.\n\nPART 8\n\nCONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED\nAMENDMENTS TO OTHER ACTS AND\nSAVING AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISION\n\nPart 8 comprises clauses 153 to 156.

This is an intimate recording of B.\n\n## (3) In this section, a person is doing a private act if, under circumstances in which the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy, the person —\n\n (a) is in a state where the person’s genital or anal region, or 20 breasts (if the person is a female), are exposed or covered only by underwear;\n\n (b) is using a toilet, showering or bathing; or\n\n (c) is doing a sexual act that is not of a kind ordinarily done in\n public. 25\n\n_Illustration_\n\n_A is showering in an open‑concept shower cubicle at the changing room of a_\nswimming pool and cannot reasonably expect not to be casually observed.\nHowever, A has a reasonable expectation of privacy that A will not be recorded by\n\na video camera and the recording communicated online. A is doing a private act. 30\n\n## Image‑based child abuse\n\n 14.—(1) In this Act, “image‑based child abuse” means the communication of online material that contains any of the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n30\n\n## (a) a child abuse image or recording of a person (called in this section the victim);\n\n (b) an offer to sell or distribute a child abuse image or recording of the victim;\n\n5 (c) an advertisement of a child abuse image or recording of the\n## victim;\n\n (d) any material which appears to be designed or communicated in such a way as to lead to any child abuse image or recording of the victim.\n\n10 _Explanation.— Material in subsection (1)(d) includes phrases, keywords,_\ndescriptions, hints or hyperlinks published on an online location which enable a\nperson interested in viewing a child abuse image or recording of the victim to\nlocate or access it.\n\n## (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), “child abuse image or\n\n15 recording” means an image or a recording (including an image or a\n## recording that has been altered or generated by any means) of a person who is, or appears to a reasonable person to be, or who is implied to be, below 16 years of age (called in this section a child) —\n\n (a) that depicts the child —\n\n20 (i) as a victim of torture, cruelty or physical abuse\n## (whether or not the torture, cruelty or abuse is sexual);\n\n (ii) as a victim of sexual abuse;\n\n (iii) engaging in, or apparently engaging in, a sexual pose\n\n25 or sexual activity (whether or not in the presence of\n## another person); or\n\n (iv) in the presence of another person who is engaging in, or apparently engaging in, a sexual pose or sexual activity;\n\n30 (b) that depicts the genital or anal region (whether exposed or\n## covered) of the child where the depiction is sexual and in circumstances (whether or not apparent from the depiction) which a reasonable person would regard as offensive; or\n\n\n-----\n\n31\n\n## (c) that depicts the breasts (whether exposed or covered) of a female child where the depiction is sexual and in circumstances (whether or not apparent from the depiction) which a reasonable person would regard as\n offensive. 5\n\n (3) Despite subsection (1), “image‑based child abuse” does not include the communication of material that —\n\n (a) has a legitimate purpose related to science, medicine, education or art; and\n\n (b) does not pose an undue risk of harm to any person below 10 16 years of age.\n\n_Explanation.— Material has a legitimate purpose related to art which a_\nreasonable person would regard as art.\n\n_Illustration_\n\n_A is a photo‑journalist in a war zone. A takes a photo of a child victim of_ 15\ntorture and communicates this online as part of A’s work as a photo‑journalist. A’s\ncommunication has a legitimate purpose related to education.\n\n## (4) In this section, “distribute” has the meaning given by section 13(2).\n\n Online impersonation 20\n\n 15. In this Act, “online impersonation” means online activity conducted by one person (called in this section X) in respect of another person (called in this section the victim) which —\n\n (a) involves X pretending to be the victim without the victim’s\n consent; and 25\n\n (b) would lead a reasonable person to believe that the online activity was conducted by the victim when this was not in fact the case.\n\n_Explanation.— Parody, satire or commentary which no reasonable person_\n\nwould believe is made by a person is not online impersonation of that person. 30\n\n\n-----\n\n32\n\n_Illustration_\n\n_X, a comedian, performs on X’s social media an impersonation of a public_\nfigure for the purposes of entertainment and satire, which no reasonable person\nwould believe is performed by that public figure. X’s online activity is not online\n5 impersonation.\n\n## Inauthentic material abuse\n\n 16.—(1) In this Act, “inauthentic material abuse” means the communication of inauthentic material of a person (called in this section the victim) that a reasonable person would conclude is likely\n\n10 to cause the victim harassment, alarm, distress or humiliation because\n## it is false or misleading.\n\n_Illustration_\n\n_X posts inauthentic material of Y with prominent words on the representation_\nindicating that it is generated using generative artificial intelligence technology.\n15 This is not material that persons in Singapore would reasonably believe is\nauthentic.\n\n## (2) In this section, “inauthentic material”, in relation to a victim, means any audio, visual or audiovisual material —\n\n (a) that has been altered or generated using digital means;\n\n20 (b) that is a false or misleading depiction, whether express or\n## implied, of the victim’s words, actions or conduct, even though the victim may not appear in the material; and\n\n (c) that is realistic enough such that a reasonable person would believe that the victim said such words or engaged in such\n\n25 actions or conduct.\n\n_Explanation 1.— A depiction of the victim saying or engaging in anything_\nincludes a depiction of the victim’s likeness saying or engaging in that thing.\n\n_Explanation 2.— The technology known as generative artificial intelligence_\nis an example of digital means by which content could be altered or generated.\n\n30 _Illustrations_\n\n(a) X posts an image of Y standing on a stage, with a text bubble\nsuperimposed on the image containing words allegedly spoken by Y. The image is\nnot realistic enough for a reasonable person to believe Y spoke those words.\n\n\n-----\n\n33\n\n(b) X posts audiovisual material depicting Y engaged in certain conduct, with\na prominent label on the material indicating that it is generated using generative\nartificial intelligence technology. Because of this label, the material is not realistic\nenough for a reasonable person to believe Y engaged in that conduct.\n\n(c) X posts an image of a car driving into a pedestrian. This image was 5\ncreated by taking a photograph of a car and digitally replacing its number plate\nwith that of a car belonging to Y, so that it implies that Y had driven Y’s car into the\npedestrian. The image is realistic enough such that a reasonable person would\nbelieve Y had done so. This is inauthentic material depicting Y’s conduct, even\n\nthough Y does not appear in the image. 10\n\n## Publication of false material\n\n 17.—(1) In this Act, “publication of false material” means —\n\n (a) the publication of online material that contains or consists of a false statement of fact about a person (called in this\n section the victim); and 15\n\n (b) that a reasonable person would conclude is likely to cause harm to the victim.\n\n (2) The following apply for the purposes of ascertaining whether online material contains or consists of a statement of fact which bears\n a particular meaning: 20\n\n (a) the statement is to be ascertained from a reasonable interpretation of the online material whether wholly or in part, and whether on its own or in the context in which it appears;\n\n (b) there can be more than one reasonable interpretation of the 25 online material;\n\n (c) a statement of fact is a statement that a reasonable person seeing, hearing or otherwise perceiving it would consider to be a representation of fact.\n\n Publication of statement harmful to reputation 30\n\n 18.—(1) In this Act, “publication of statement harmful to reputation” means the publication of online material that contains or consists of a statement that a reasonable person would conclude is likely to cause to a person (called in this section the victim) —\n\n\n-----\n\n34\n\n## (a) harm to the reputation of the victim; and\n\n (b) any other additional harm to the victim.\n\n (2) The following apply for the purposes of ascertaining whether online material contains or consists of a statement which bears a\n\n5 particular meaning:\n\n## (a) the statement is to be ascertained from a reasonable interpretation of the online material whether wholly or in part, and whether on its own or in the context in which it appears;\n\n10 (b) there can be more than one reasonable interpretation of the\n## online material;\n\n (c) the statement may be a statement of fact or an opinion, and if a statement of fact, it may be a true or false statement of fact.\n\n15 **Online instigation of disproportionate harm**\n\n## 19.—(1) In this Act (other than Part 10), “online instigation of disproportionate harm” means the communication of online material that contains or consists of a statement where the following requirements are met:\n\n20 (a) the statement tends to instigate the public or a section of the\n## public to act or omit to act in response to an alleged speech or conduct of a person (called in this section the victim) or a person associated with the victim (called in this section the victim’s associate);\n\n25 (b) the act or omission that the statement tends to instigate\n## would increase the risk of the victim suffering harm;\n\n (c) the act or omission or the harm mentioned in paragraph (b) is disproportionate to —\n\n (i) where the statement tends to instigate a response to\n\n30 an alleged speech or conduct of the victim — the\n## wrongfulness (if any) of the alleged speech or conduct, or of any relevant actual speech or conduct, of the victim; or\n\n\n-----\n\n35\n\n## (ii) where the statement tends to instigate a response to an alleged speech or conduct of the victim’s associate —\n\n (A) the wrongfulness (if any) of the alleged speech\n or conduct, or of any relevant actual speech or 5 conduct, of the victim’s associate; and\n\n (B) the extent and nature of the association (if any) between the victim and the victim’s associate’s alleged or actual speech or conduct, as the case\n may be. 10\n\n_Illustration_\n\n_A is the father of B. B acted in a highly offensive manner. C makes a statement_\nthat tends to instigate the public to act in a manner that increases the risk of harm to\n_A in response to B’s conduct. In assessing the extent and nature of the association_\n\n(if any) between the victim and the victim’s associate’s conduct (as mentioned in 15\nsubsection (1)(c)(ii)(B)), so as to determine whether the requirement of\ndisproportionality in subsection (1)(c) is met, the Commissioner may consider\nwhether A taught B to act or not to act in that way.\n\n## (2) The following apply for the purposes of ascertaining whether\n online material contains or consists of a statement which bears a 20 particular meaning:\n\n (a) the statement is to be ascertained from a reasonable interpretation of the online material whether wholly or in part, and whether on its own or in the context in which it\n appears; 25\n\n (b) there can be more than one reasonable interpretation.\n\n (3) In assessing whether the requirement of disproportionality in subsection (1)(c) is satisfied, the Commissioner may consider —\n\n (a) the nature of the act or omission that the statement tends to\n instigate, including whether the act or omission is or is 30 likely to constitute a criminal offence under any written law;\n\n (b) the nature of the harm mentioned in subsection (1)(b), including the severity of that harm;\n\n\n-----\n\n36\n\n## (c) whether the victim or the victim’s associate did in fact engage in the alleged speech or conduct;\n\n (d) whether the alleged speech or conduct, or any relevant actual speech or conduct of the victim or the victim’s\n\n5 associate, would be a reasonable expression of an opinion\n## on a matter of public interest or public controversy; and\n\n (e) any other relevant factor.\n\n (4) This section does not apply where the act or omission that the statement tends to instigate is any of the following:\n\n10 (a) voting for any candidate in an election for the purpose of\n## electing the President or a Member of Parliament;\n\n (b) conducting or otherwise participating in or attending a political activity;\n\n (c) communicating a statement calling for the removal or\n\n15 suspension of a political office holder or Member of\n## Parliament from his or her office;\n\n (d) communicating a statement to a political office holder, a Member of Parliament or a public body on a matter of public interest or public controversy.\n\n20 (5) In this section —\n\n## “candidate” has the meaning given by the Presidential Elections Act 1991 or the Parliamentary Elections Act 1954, as the case may be;\n\n “political activity” includes —\n\n25 (a) any activity that is directed to influence, or seek to\n## influence, the outcome of an election to the office of the President, a general election of Members of Parliament, a by‑election of a Member of Parliament, or a referendum;\n\n30 (b) any activity that is directed towards promoting the\n## interests of a political party or other group of persons organised in Singapore for a political object; and\n\n\n-----\n\n37\n\n## (c) any activity that is directed to bring about, or seek to bring about, changes of the law in the whole or a part of Singapore, or to otherwise influence, or seek to influence, the legislative process or outcome in\n Singapore; 5\n\n “political office holder” means the holder of the office of —\n\n (a) the President;\n\n (b) the Prime Minister;\n\n (c) a Deputy Prime Minister;\n\n (d) a Minister, Senior Minister or Co‑ordinating 10 Minister;\n\n (e) a Senior Minister of State or Minister of State;\n\n (f) a Senior Parliamentary Secretary or Parliamentary Secretary;\n\n (g) the Speaker of Parliament or a Deputy Speaker of 15 Parliament;\n\n (h) a Mayor;\n\n (i) a Political Secretary; or\n\n (j) the Leader of the House;\n\n “public body” means — 20\n\n (a) the Government, including any ministry, department, agency or Organ of State;\n\n (b) a prescribed statutory body; and\n\n (c) any prescribed board, prescribed commission,\n prescribed committee or similar prescribed body, 25 whether corporate or unincorporate.\n\n Incitement of enmity\n\n 20.—(1) In this Act, “incitement of enmity” means the communication of online material that a reasonable person would\n conclude incites, or is likely to incite, feelings of enmity, hatred or 30 hostility against any group in Singapore.\n\n\n-----\n\n38\n\n## (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to —\n\n (a) communication which is private or domestic in nature, having regard to —\n\n (i) the number of persons who are likely to hear, see or\n\n5 otherwise perceive the communication in question;\n\n## (ii) the relationship between the persons that the communication is being or has been made; and\n\n (iii) all other relevant circumstances; or\n\n (b) communication made in circumstances that may\n\n10 reasonably be taken to indicate that the parties to the\n## communication desire it to be heard, seen or otherwise perceived only by themselves.\n\n (3) To avoid doubt, the definition in subsection (1) is not satisfied solely because one or more persons feel offended by or\n\n15 uncomfortable with the material mentioned in that subsection.\n\n## (4) The following factors are relevant in considering whether a reasonable person would conclude that a communication incites, or is likely to incite, feelings of enmity, hatred or hostility against any group in Singapore:\n\n20 (a) whether the material dehumanises any person or persons,\n## or otherwise portrays them as less than human;\n\n (b) the intensity of the feelings of enmity, hatred or hostility that are incited or are likely to be incited;\n\n (c) the tendency of the material to incite any act or omission\n\n25 that is or is likely to constitute a criminal offence under any\n## written law.\n\n (5) In this section, “group” means a group of persons of any description.\n\n Incitement of violence\n\n30 **21.—(1) In** this Act, “incitement of violence” means the\n## communication of online material that a reasonable person would\n\n\n-----\n\n39\n\n## conclude incites or is likely to incite one or more persons to use unlawful force or unlawful violence against any group in Singapore.\n\n (2) In this section, “group” means a group of persons of any description.\n\n PART 4 5\n\n REPORTS\n\n Eligibility to make report\n\n 22.—(1) A victim of an alleged online harmful activity (other than incitement of enmity and incitement of violence) who is —\n\n (a) a citizen of Singapore;

The Bill also makes related\namendments to the Family Justice Act 2014 and the Info‑communications Media\nDevelopment Authority Act 2016.\n\n\n-----\n\n135\n\nPART 1\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement. The clause also provides\nthat a commencement notification may specify different dates for different\nprovisions of the Schedule to come into operation.\n\nClause 2 sets out the purposes of the Bill which are —\n\n(a) to provide persons affected by online harmful activity with timely\nmeans of redress and statutory rights of action and remedies in court\nproceedings;\n\n(b) to improve and promote online safety for persons;\n\n(c) to deter and prevent online harmful activity and mitigate harm caused\nto persons by such activity; and\n\n(d) to promote accountability and responsible and reasonable conduct\namong participants and stakeholders in the online environment.\n\nClause 3 is a general interpretation provision. The clause contains definitions\nof terms used in the Bill. Technical terms such as “access”, “account”, “app”, “app\ndistribution service”, “material”, “online account”, “online activity”, “online\nlocation”, “online material” and “online service” are defined. Terms relating to the\nnotices, directions and orders that may be given under the Bill, such as “order\nfollowing non‑compliance”, “Part 5 direction”, “relevant account”, “relevant\nonline activity”, “relevant location”, “relevant material” and “relevant service”\nare also defined. Key persons who can be subject to duties, notices, directions or\norders under the Bill are also defined, such as “administrator”, “communicator”\nand “online service provider”. The term “online harmful activity” is defined so\nthat its meaning excludes any type of online harmful activity for which the\nrelevant definition in Part 3 has not yet been brought into operation. This is to cater\nfor staged implementation of the Bill.\n\nClause 4 limits the application of the Bill as regards public agencies. Public\nagencies cannot avail themselves of the measures and reliefs under the Bill, being\nunable to make a report to the Commissioner under Part 4 (except on behalf of\nanother person) or to sue under the statutory torts under Parts 10, 11 and 12. Public\nagencies also cannot be the subject or recipient of any direction or order of the\nCommissioner under Part 5 or 7 or be liable in any proceedings under the statutory\ntorts under Parts 10, 11 and 12. However, a public agency can make a report under\nPart 4 on behalf of a person, or assist a person to make such a report. A public\nagency can also make an application for reconsideration or appeal under Part 7 on\nbehalf of a person, or assist a person to make such an application.\n\n\n-----\n\n136\n\nPART 2\n\nADMINISTRATION OF ACT\n\nPart 2 sets out provisions concerning the administration of the Bill.\n\nClause 5 provides for the appointment of the Commissioner, Deputy\nCommissioners of Online Safety and Assistant Commissioners of Online\nSafety, for the administration of Parts 2 to 9 and to perform the various\nfunctions set out in the clause. The Commissioner, Deputy Commissioners and\nAssistant Commissioners of Online Safety are deemed to be public servants for\nthe purposes of the Penal Code 1871. The Minister may give the Commissioner\ndirections of a general or special character as to the exercise of the\nCommissioner’s powers, discretion and duties, that are not inconsistent with\nthe provisions of the Bill.\n\nClause 6 provides for the appointment of authorised officers. Authorised\nofficers may be appointed from among public officers or officers or employees of\nany statutory body, or may be any other individual who has suitable training or\nexpertise to properly exercise the functions and powers delegated to an authorised\nofficer. Every person appointed as an authorised officer is deemed to be a public\nservant for the purposes of the Penal Code 1871. The Commissioner may delegate\nhis or her functions or powers (with some exceptions) to authorised officers,\nsubject to such conditions or limitations set out in the Bill or specified by the\nCommissioner. The delegated functions or powers may be generally exercisable\nby the authorised officer in question or limited to a particular report made under\nPart 4 or instance of online harmful activity.\n\nClause 7 provides that the Commissioner may consult with any person that the\nCommissioner thinks appropriate for the purposes of performing any of the\nCommissioner’s duties and functions.\n\nClause 8 empowers the Commissioner to issue written advisory guidelines to\nprovide practical guidance or certainty in respect of requirements imposed under\nParts 1 to 9, to indicate the manner in which the Commissioner will interpret the\nprovisions of the Bill, and on any other matter about online harmful activity or\nonline safety that the Commissioner considers necessary. Such advisory\nguidelines do not have any legislative effect.\n\nPART 3\n\nONLINE HARMFUL ACTIVITIES\n\nPart 3 sets out and defines online harmful activities.\n\nClause 9 defines “online harassment”, taking reference from Part 2 of the\nProtection from Harassment Act 2014. “Online harassment” is defined as the\ncommunication of online material that a reasonable person would conclude is\n\n\n-----\n\n137\n\nthreatening, abusive, insulting, sexual or indecent, and likely to cause a person\n(called the victim) harassment, alarm, distress or humiliation.\n\nThe inclusion of “sexual or indecent” makes it clear that the communication of\nsuch online material can constitute online harassment. The inclusion of\n“humiliation” makes it clear that humiliation is a form of actionable harm that\ncan be suffered by victims of online harassment, in addition to harassment, alarm\nor distress.\n\n“Online harassment” does not include the communication of sexual or indecent\nmaterial that has a legitimate purpose related to science, medicine, education or\nart. Online material has a legitimate purpose related to art which a reasonable\nperson would regard as art.\n\nThe clause makes clear that a person (X) can be a victim even if the\ncommunication is not directed at X, where X’s personal relationship with the\nperson targeted means that X is likely to be caused harassment, alarm, distress or\nhumiliation from it. For example, the personal relationship could be that of a\nspouse or parent. The clause also provides that, for the purposes of Parts 4, 5 and 6\nonly, multiple acts when considered together may amount to online harassment\neven if each of the individual acts on its own does not. See also the definition of\n“online harassment” in clause 3.\n\nClause 10 defines “doxxing”, taking reference from Part 2 of the Protection\nfrom Harassment Act 2014. “Doxxing” is defined as the publication of any\nidentity information of a person that a reasonable person would conclude was\nlikely to have been intended to cause harassment, alarm, distress or humiliation to\nthat person or any related person (both of whom would be a victim under the\nclause). That is to say, it is not the impact of the publication on the victim per se,\nbut the objectively inferred intention of the person making the publication that is\nmaterial. The clause also sets out what “identity information” means, including a\nperson’s residential address, telephone number, and any information about the\nperson’s family, employment or education.\n\nClause 11 defines “non‑consensual disclosure of private information” to mean\nthe publication of any private information of a person (called the victim) without\nthe victim’s consent, where a reasonable person would conclude that the\npublication was likely to cause the victim harassment, alarm, distress or\nhumiliation. The private information is information about a person that was not\nwidely available to the public at large prior to the publication. Information that is\nwidely available to the public at large would not be regarded as private\ninformation. Regulations may clarify the types of information to be considered (or\nnot to be considered) private information. The clause also does not apply to any\nprivate information that was obtained by perceiving in public or through publicly\navailable information such as the physical appearance or the conduct or activities\nof the person. This online harmful activity is not the subject of any statutory tort\nunder Part 10, 11 or 12. To avoid doubt, the clause does not seek to recognise or\n\n\n-----\n\n138\n\ncodify any common law cause of action for misuse of private information or\nbreach of confidence, nor create a right to privacy.\n\nClause 12 defines “online stalking”, taking reference from Part 2 of the\nProtection from Harassment Act 2014. “Online stalking” is defined as a course of\nonline conduct engaged in by one person in respect of another person (called the\nvictim) that involves online acts or omissions associated with stalking, and that a\nreasonable person would conclude is likely to cause the victim harassment, alarm,\ndistress or humiliation. The victim may also be a related person to the person\nwhom the acts or omissions were directed at, so long as a reasonable person would\nconclude that the course of online conduct would also be likely to cause the victim\nharassment, alarm, distress or humiliation. Non‑exhaustive examples of online\nacts or omissions associated with stalking are listed. The clause also sets out a list\nof factors which are relevant in considering whether a reasonable person would\nconclude a course of online conduct is likely to cause harassment, alarm, distress\nor humiliation. For example, using a social media account to follow another\nperson’s public social media page and to regularly check for updates, without\nmore, would not constitute online stalking.\n\nClause 13 defines “intimate image abuse” to mean the communication of\nonline material that contains one of the following, without the person’s (called the\nvictim) consent, that a reasonable person would conclude is likely to cause the\nvictim harassment, alarm, distress or humiliation:\n\n(a) an intimate image or recording of the victim;\n\n(b) an offer to sell or distribute an intimate image or recording of the\nvictim;\n\n(c) an advertisement of an intimate image or recording of the victim.\n\nThe clause defines “intimate image or recording” and what it means to\n“distribute” an “intimate image or recording”, and also provides clarification as to\nwhat it means for a person to be doing a private act. The clause clarifies that an\nintimate image or recording includes an image or a recording that has been altered\nor generated by any means, both digital and non‑digital, such that a reasonable\nperson would believe it depicts the victim.\n\nClause 14 defines “image‑based child abuse” to mean the communication of\nonline material that contains any of the following:\n\n(a) a child abuse image or recording of a person (called the victim);\n\n(b) an offer to sell or distribute a child abuse image or recording of the\nvictim;\n\n(c) an advertisement of a child abuse image or recording of the victim;\n\n(d) any material which appears to be designed or communicated in such a\nway as to lead to any child abuse image or recording of the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\n139\n\nClause 14(1)(d) refers to online material such as phrases, keywords,\ndescriptions, hints or hyperlinks which appear designed or communicated in\nsuch a way as to lead to any child abuse image or recording of the victim. This\nincludes material that may appear innocuous to some, but which is designed or\ncommunicated in a way to enable persons who are interested in such material to\nlocate or access them. This practice is colloquially known as “breadcrumbing”.\n\nThe clause defines “child abuse image or recording” and also clarifies that\n“image‑based child abuse” does not include the communication of material that\nhas a legitimate purpose related to science, medicine, education or art which does\nnot pose an undue risk of harm to any person below 16 years of age. A material has\na legitimate purpose related to art which reasonable persons would regard as art.\nThe clause clarifies that a child abuse image or recording includes an image or a\nrecording that has been altered or generated by any means, both digital and\nnon‑digital, such that a reasonable person would believe it depicts a child as a\nvictim of child abuse.\n\nClause 15 defines “online impersonation” to mean online activity conducted by\na person (X) in respect of another person (called the victim) that involves X\npretending to be the victim, without the victim’s consent and which would lead a\nreasonable person to believe that the online activity was conducted by the victim\nwhen this was not in fact the case. It is not necessary to show that the\nimpersonation has caused, or is likely to cause, harm such as harassment, alarm,\ndistress or humiliation, as impersonation by its nature carries clear potential to\ncause harm to the victim. The clause also clarifies that parody, satire or\ncommentary which no reasonable person would believe is made by the victim is\nnot online impersonation.\n\nClause 16 defines “inauthentic material abuse” to mean the communication of\ninauthentic material of a person (called the victim) that a reasonable person would\nconclude is likely to cause the victim harassment, alarm, distress or humiliation\nbecause it is false or misleading. “Inauthentic material” means any audio, visual or\naudiovisual material that has been altered or generated using digital means. It must\nbe a false or misleading depiction, whether express or implied, of the victim’s\nwords, actions or conduct, that is realistic enough such that a reasonable person\nwould believe that the victim said such words or did such actions or conduct. This\nincludes material colloquially known as “deepfakes”. The victim need not appear\nin the inauthentic material.\n\nClause 17 defines “publication of false material” to mean the publication of\nmaterial that contains or consists of a false statement of fact about a person (called\nthe victim) that a reasonable person would conclude is likely to cause harm to the\nvictim. The harm may include, but is not limited to, reputational harm, emotional\ndistress and financial loss. It must first be ascertained whether the online material\ncontains or consists of a statement of fact which bears a particular meaning on a\n\n\n-----\n\n140\n\nreasonable interpretation described in clause 17(2). The statement so ascertained\nmust then be determined to be false.\n\nClause 18 defines “publication of statement harmful to reputation” to mean the\npublication of online material that contains or consists of a statement that a\nreasonable person would conclude is likely to cause a person (called the victim)\nharm to the victim’s reputation and any other additional harm such as emotional\ndistress and financial loss.\n\nClause 19 defines “online instigation of disproportionate harm” to mean the\ncommunication of a statement where certain requirements are met. The first\nrequirement (clause 19(1)(a)) is that the statement must tend to instigate the public\nor a section of the public to act or omit to act in response to an alleged speech or\nconduct of a victim or an associate of the victim. The second requirement\n(clause 19(1)(b)) is that the act or omission that the statement tends to instigate\nwould increase the risk of the victim suffering harm. The third requirement, where\nthe statement tends to instigate a response to an alleged speech or conduct of the\nvictim (clause 19(1)(c)(i)), is that the act or omission or the harm referred to in the\nsecond requirement is disproportionate to the wrongfulness (if any) of the alleged\nspeech or conduct, or of any relevant actual speech or conduct, of the victim.\nWhere the statement tends to instigate a response to the alleged speech or conduct\nof the victim’s associate (clause 19(1)(c)(ii)), the act or omission or the harm\nreferred to in the second requirement must also be disproportionate to the extent\nand nature of the association (if any) between the victim and the victim’s\nassociate’s alleged or actual speech or conduct, as the case may be.\n\nThis definition does not apply to Part 10 which contains a similar but different\ndefinition of “online instigation of disproportionate harm”. In assessing whether\nthe second requirement is met, the Commissioner may have regard to the factors\nlisted in the clause or any other relevant factor.\n\nClause 19(4) provides for an exception for statements that tend to instigate the\npublic to undertake core political activities, such as calling for others to vote for a\ncandidate in a Presidential or Parliamentary election. The making of such\nstatements will not constitute “online instigation of disproportionate harm”.\n\nClause 20 defines “incitement of enmity” to mean the communication of online\nmaterial that a reasonable person would conclude incites, or is likely to incite,\nfeelings of enmity, hatred or hostility against any group in Singapore. Clause 20(4)\nlists the relevant factors to be considered. They are whether the material\ndehumanises any person or persons, or otherwise portrays them as less than\nhuman, the intensity of the feelings of enmity, hatred or hostility that are or are\nlikely to be incited and the tendency of the material to incite any act or omission\nthat is or is likely to constitute a criminal offence. Statements describing or\nexpressing an opinion on the law or government policy, without more, would not\nconstitute incitement of enmity. Neither would statements which merely describe\na person’s beliefs, such as a statement that the beliefs or practices of a group is\n\n\n-----\n\n141\n\ninconsistent with some other set of beliefs or practices. Communication of\nmaterial does not constitute incitement of enmity solely because one or more\npersons feels offended by or uncomfortable with the material communicated. The\nclause also does not apply to private or domestic communication and\ncommunication made in circumstances that may reasonably be taken to indicate\nthat the parties to the communication desire it to be perceived only by themselves.\n\nClause 21 defines “incitement of violence” to mean the communication of\nonline material that a reasonable person would conclude incites or is likely to\nincite one or more persons to use unlawful force or violence against any group in\nSingapore.\n\nPART 4\n\nREPORTS\n\nPart 4 relates to reports that may be made to the Commissioner about alleged\nonline harmful activity.\n\nClause 22 sets out the persons who are eligible to make a report to the\nCommissioner about any alleged online harmful activity. This includes victims, as\ndefined in the definitions of the respective online harmful activity in Part 3, who\nare Singapore citizens, permanent residents of Singapore and other persons with a\nprescribed connection to Singapore. In addition to the victim, the following\npersons may make a report on behalf of the victim, if that person is —\n\n(a) the victim’s parent or guardian, where the victim is below 18 years of\nage;\n\n(b) a person (including an entity or a public agency) of such description as\nmay be prescribed in relation to each type or description of online\nharmful activity; or\n\n(c) a person (including an entity or a public agency) whom or which has\nobtained the written authorisation or written consent of the victim.\n\nThe person mentioned in paragraph (b) may be allowed to make reports in respect\nof some online harmful activities but not others. Such a person does not require the\nwritten authorisation or written consent of the victim before making a report.\n\nClause 23 provides that an eligible person under clause 22 may make a report\nof the alleged online harmful activity to the Commissioner. A person making a\nreport must comply with prescribed requirements which may include\npreconditions which must be satisfied before the report is made. The report\nmust be made in the form and manner that the Commissioner may determine and\nbe accompanied by any other particulars, statements, information or documents as\nthe Commissioner may require.\n\n\n-----\n\n142\n\nClause 24 provides that, upon receipt of a report under clause 23(1), the\nCommissioner must assess the report to determine whether or what further action,\nincluding any investigation, is appropriate. The Commissioner may seek and\nreceive any information that the Commissioner considers will assist the\nCommissioner in the conduct of the Commissioner’s assessment or\ninvestigation. For the purposes of investigating the report, the Commissioner\nmay exercise the Commissioner’s powers of investigation in clauses 49 and 51.\nThe Commissioner may suspend, discontinue or refuse to assess a report, or the\nconduct of an investigation, or the taking of any further action if the\nCommissioner thinks fit.\n\nClause 25 provides that the Commissioner may dismiss any report, without any\nassessment, investigation or further action, if the Commissioner is satisfied that\nthe report is trivial, frivolous or vexatious or not made in good faith.\n\nThe Commissioner may refuse to consider any report from a person specified\nby the Commissioner, or in relation to a specified matter, if the Commissioner has\nreceived persistent trivial, frivolous or vexatious reports from the specified person\nor in relation to the specified matter. Where the Commissioner has made such a\ndecision, the Commissioner may inform the person affected by the decision and\nthe period for which it applies, which must not exceed 3 years after the date of the\ndecision.\n\nAny decision under clause 25 is final and is not subject to reconsideration or\nappeal under the Bill.\n\nPART 5\n\nPOWERS TO GIVE DIRECTIONS AND ORDERS\n\nPart 5 relates to the Commissioner’s powers to give directions and orders\nfollowing non‑compliance with directions.\n\nClause 26 provides that after receiving a report made under Part 4 by or on\nbehalf of a person, the Commissioner may give one or more Part 5 directions if the\nCommissioner has reason to suspect that online harmful activity was conducted in\nrespect of the person or the group, as the case may be. The clause makes clear that\nthe Commissioner may reach this conclusion solely on the basis of an examination\nof the report, without having to conduct further investigation. The Commissioner\nwill largely give Part 5 directions in relation to online harmful activity mentioned\nby the victim in the report, but may also give Part 5 directions in relation to online\nharmful activity not directly mentioned in the report, if needed. This may occur if\nthe Commissioner comes across such online harmful activity through the\nCommissioner’s investigations in relation to the report.\n\nA Part 5 direction may be given against a person (including an entity) whether\nor not the person is in Singapore, or is registered or operating in Singapore. A\n\n\n-----\n\n143\n\nPart 5 direction may direct a person to do an act or to not do an act, whether in\nSingapore or outside Singapore.\n\nOnly a right‑of‑reply (user) direction or a right‑of‑reply (online service)\ndirection may be given in respect of a publication of false material as defined in\nclause 17, unless the false online material published contains or consists of a false\nstatement of fact that the victim approved, endorsed, promoted, provided a\ntestimonial for or invested in, or is affiliated or associated with, any genuine or\npurported trade, investment, business, commercial activity, or online location\nsoliciting funding, donations or financial support.\n\nOnly a right‑of‑reply (user) direction or a right‑of‑reply (online service)\ndirection may be given in respect of a publication of statement harmful to\nreputation as defined in clause 18.\n\nClause 27 sets out a list of factors which the Commissioner may take into\naccount in the exercise of discretion as to whether to give a Part 5 direction or the\ntype and scope of the direction to be given.\n\nClause 28 sets out the Part 5 directions and who each Part 5 direction may be\ngiven to.\n\nClause 29 describes a stop communication direction. The recipient may be a\ncommunicator of the relevant material, an administrator of the relevant location at\nwhich the relevant material is communicated or an administrator of the relevant\nlocation. The direction may require the recipient to remove, to stop storing,\nposting, providing or transmitting, the relevant material or any material similar to\nthe relevant material, or to suspend, remove, delete or terminate the relevant\nlocation, by a specified time, such that the relevant material or the relevant\nlocation cannot be accessed by persons in Singapore.\n\nClause 30 describes a stop communication (class of material) direction. The\nrecipient may be a communicator of any online material in the relevant class of\nmaterial or an administrator of a relevant location at which any online material in\nthe relevant class of material is communicated. The direction may require the\nrecipient to remove, or to stop storing, posting, providing or transmitting, the\nrelevant class of material, by a specified time, such that the relevant class of\nmaterial cannot be accessed by persons in Singapore. The relevant class of\nmaterial must be identified in the direction by one or more specific identifiers\nwhich relate to the online harmful activity concerned. The direction may apply not\nonly to online material already accessible to persons in Singapore when the\ndirection is given, but also to online material in the relevant class of material that is\nfirst made accessible to persons in Singapore after the direction is given.\n\nClause 31 describes a restraining direction. The recipient may be a\ncommunicator of the relevant material, a person who conducted the relevant\nonline activity or an administrator of the relevant location. The direction requires\n\n\n-----\n\n144\n\nthe recipient to refrain, for a specified period or indefinitely, from all or any of the\nfollowing:\n\n(a) communicating any online material similar or identical to the relevant\nmaterial;\n\n(b) conducting any online activity similar or identical to the relevant\nonline activity;\n\n(c) developing and maintaining, or otherwise administering an online\nlocation in a manner that facilitates or permits the conduct of the\nrelevant online activity at that location.\n\nClause 32 describes an access disabling direction. The recipient may be an\nonline service provider. The direction requires the recipient to disable access by\nend‑users in Singapore to one or more of the following, by a specified time:\n\n(a) any relevant material stored, posted, provided or transmitted on or\nthrough the relevant service;\n\n(b) any relevant location on the relevant service.\n\nIf the recipient is a prescribed online service provider, it may also be required\nto disable access by end‑users in Singapore to identical copies of the relevant\nmaterial stored, posted, provided or transmitted on or through the relevant service.\nWhere the direction to a prescribed online service provider imposes a requirement\nto disable access to a relevant location, the direction may also —\n\n(a) specify relevant material that is or was accessible at that relevant\nlocation; and\n\n(b) require the recipient to disable access by end‑users in Singapore to\nother locations on the relevant service at which the recipient knows or\nought reasonably to know online material identical to the relevant\nmaterial can be accessed. This requirement may only be imposed for a\nspecified period not exceeding 2 years after the date the direction is\ngiven.\n\nClause 33 describes an access disabling (class of material) direction. The\nrecipient may be a prescribed online service provider. This direction requires the\nrecipient to disable access by end‑users in Singapore to any relevant class of\nmaterial stored, posted, provided or transmitted on or through the relevant service.\nThe relevant class of material must be identified in the direction by one or more\nspecific identifiers which relate to the online harmful activity concerned. The\ndirection may apply not only to online material already accessible to persons in\nSingapore when the direction is given, but also to online material in the relevant\nclass of material that is first made accessible to end‑users in Singapore after the\ndirection is given.\n\n\n-----\n\n145\n\nClause 34 describes a right‑of‑reply (user) direction. The recipient may be a\ncommunicator of the relevant material or an administrator of the relevant location.\nThe direction may only be given in respect of a publication of false online\nmaterial, a publication of statement harmful to reputation and an online instigation\nof disproportionate harm. The direction requires the recipient to communicate in\nSingapore a reply notice to a specified person or description of persons, in a\nspecified form and manner, and within a specified time. Where the direction\nrequires the reply notice to be placed in specified proximity to every copy of\nmaterial substantially similar to the relevant material, the direction may apply not\nonly to online material (substantially similar to the relevant material) already\naccessible to persons in Singapore when the direction is given, but also to online\nmaterial that is first made accessible to persons in Singapore after the direction is\ngiven. Material that is substantially similar to the relevant material includes\nmaterial that is identical to the relevant material.\n\nClause 35 describes a right‑of‑reply (online service) direction. The recipient\nmay be an online service provider. The direction may only be given in respect of a\npublication of false online material, a publication of statement harmful to\nreputation and an online instigation of disproportionate harm. The direction\nrequires the recipient to communicate a reply notice, by means of the online\nservice provided by the recipient, to all end‑users in Singapore who access the\nrelevant material provided on or through the online service from any specified\ntime. If the recipient is a prescribed online service provider, it may be required to\ncarry out the following additional acts:\n\n(a) communicate the reply notice by means of its online service to all\nend‑users in Singapore who access identical copies of the relevant\nmaterial by means of that online service from a specified time;\n\n(b) communicate the reply notice by any means and by a specified time to\nall end‑users in Singapore that it knows had accessed the relevant\nmaterial or identical copies of the relevant material (or both) by means\nof that online service at any time before the specified time mentioned\nin clause 35(1).\n\nClause 36 requires reply notices communicated by online service providers\npursuant to a right‑of‑reply (online service) direction to be easily perceived and\ndefines what is meant by “easily perceived”. A reply notice is taken to be easily\nperceived if the notice is published in accordance with measures prescribed by\nregulations. If the Commissioner is of the view that the reply notice is not easily\nperceived, the Commissioner may require, by written notice, the person to whom\nthe direction is given, to remedy the non‑compliance within a specified time.\n\nClause 37 describes a labelling direction. The recipient may be an\nadministrator of the relevant location. The direction requires the recipient to\npublish a label at the relevant location, in the form and manner specified in the\ndirection, for a specified period not exceeding 18 months. “Label” means a notice\n\n\n-----\n\n146\n\nin the terms specified in the direction, that the recipient has been subject to one or\nmore Part 5 directions, or that online harmful activity that was the subject of one or\nmore Part 5 directions had occurred at the relevant location. This does not apply to\nPart 5 directions which have been cancelled, revoked or substituted.\n\nClause 38 describes an account restriction (administrator) direction. The\nrecipient may be an administrator of the relevant location. The direction requires\nthe recipient to disallow or restrict, by a specified time, a relevant Singapore\naccount from accessing the relevant location for a specified period or indefinitely.\nThe direction may also require the recipient to disallow or restrict access to the\nrelevant location, for a specified period or indefinitely, by any account which the\nrecipient knows or ought reasonably to know was created by the owner of the\nrelevant Singapore account after the direction had been given. This requirement\nmay only be imposed for a specified period not exceeding 2 years after the date the\ndirection is given. A “Singapore account” is defined in clause 3 to mean one in\nwhich the owner of the account is a citizen or permanent resident of Singapore, an\nentity formed, constituted or registered in Singapore, or an individual physically\npresent in Singapore.\n\nClause 39 describes an account restriction (online service) direction. The\nrecipient may be an online service provider. The direction requires the recipient to\ndo one or more of the following by a specified time:\n\n(a) disallow or restrict interaction between any relevant account on the\nrelevant service and end‑users in Singapore for a specified period or\nindefinitely;\n\n(b) disable any relevant Singapore account on the relevant online service\nfor a specified period or indefinitely.\n\nIf the recipient is a prescribed online service provider, the direction may also\nrequire the recipient to do one or more of the following, for a specified period not\nexceeding 2 years after the date the direction is given:\n\n(a) disallow or restrict interaction, for a specified period or indefinitely,\nbetween end‑users in Singapore and any account that the recipient\nknows or ought reasonably to know was created by the owner of the\nrelevant account after the direction had been given;\n\n(b) disable any Singapore account, for a specified period or indefinitely,\nthat the recipient knows or ought reasonably to know was created by\nthe owner of the relevant Singapore account after the direction had\nbeen given.\n\nClause 40 describes an engagement reduction direction.

For example, the recipient may be\nrequired to warn end‑users against communicating material in the relevant class of\nmaterial, or delay the transmission of material in the relevant class of material to\nend‑users. The relevant class of material must be identified in the direction by one\nor more specific identifiers which relate to the online harmful activity concerned.\nThe direction may apply to online material that is first made accessible to\nend‑users in Singapore, before, on or after the date the direction is given. The\ndirection must also, so far as is reasonably practicable, specify the measures which\nthe recipient is to take to reduce engagement, in a way that is sufficient to enable\nthe recipient to comply with the direction.\n\nClause 41 relates to other matters relating to Part 5 directions. A Part 5\ndirection may be given to a person either individually or as a class. It is not\nnecessary to give any person who may be affected by a Part 5 direction an\nopportunity to be heard before the direction is given. The clause also sets out what\na Part 5 direction must contain, and what a Part 5 direction may require the\nrecipient to do, including to give written notice to the Commissioner when the\nrecipient has complied with the direction. A recipient of a Part 5 direction must\ncomply with the direction until the expiry date and time (if any) stated in the\ndirection is reached, or until the direction is cancelled, revoked or substituted,\nwhichever occurs earlier.\n\nClause 42 provides that the Commissioner may cancel, vary or substitute a\nPart 5 direction on his or her own initiative at any time. Where a Part 5 direction is\ncancelled, written notice must be given to every person who has been given that\nPart 5 direction.\n\nDivision 4 contains the provisions that apply to orders following\nnon‑compliance with Part 5 directions.\n\nClause 43 provides that an order following non‑compliance may be given if the\nrecipient of a Part 5 direction (unless the direction is a right‑of‑reply (user)\ndirection or a right‑of‑reply (online service) direction) has not complied with a\nrequirement of the Part 5 direction. Like directions, an order following\nnon‑compliance may be given to a person (including an entity) whether or not\nthe person is in Singapore, or is registered or operating in Singapore. Also like\ndirections, an order following non‑compliance may direct a person to do an act or\nto not do an act, whether in Singapore or outside Singapore.\n\nClause 44 describes an access blocking order. The order requires an internet\naccess service provider to disable access by end‑users in Singapore to the relevant\nlocation by means of that internet access service, by a specified time. The relevant\nlocation must be —\n\n(a) an online location of an administrator who did not comply with a Part 5\ndirection in respect of that online location, any online material\n\n\n-----\n\n148\n\naccessible at that online location or any online activity conducted at\nthat online location; or\n\n(b) an online location at which an online service of an online service\nprovider can be accessed, where the online service provider did not\ncomply with a Part 5 direction in respect of that online service, any\nonline account, app, online material or online location accessible on or\nthrough that online service, or any online activity conducted on or\nthrough that online service.\n\nClause 45 describes an app removal order. The order requires a provider of an\napp distribution service to stop distributing the relevant app to persons in\nSingapore and stop enabling persons in Singapore to download the relevant app by\nmeans of that service, by a specified time. The relevant app must be an app used\nexclusively to access the online service provided by an online service provider\nwhich did not comply with a Part 5 direction in respect of that online service, any\nonline account, online material or online location accessible on or through that\nonline service, or any online activity conducted on or through that online service.\n\nClause 46 relates to matters relating to orders following non‑compliance. It is\nnot necessary to give any person who may be affected by an order following\nnon‑compliance an opportunity to be heard before the order is given. The clause\nalso sets out what an order following non‑compliance must contain and what an\norder following non‑compliance may require the recipient to do, including to give\nwritten notice to the Commissioner when the recipient has complied with the\norder. A recipient of an order following non‑compliance must comply with the\norder until the expiry date and time (if any) stated in the order is reached, or until\nthe order is cancelled, revoked or substituted, whichever occurs earlier.\n\nClause 47 provides that the Commissioner may cancel, vary or substitute an\norder following non‑compliance on his or her own initiative at any time. Where an\norder following non‑compliance is cancelled, written notice must be given to\nevery person who has been given that order.\n\nPART 6\n\nINFORMATION AND END‑USER IDENTITY MATTERS\n\nPart 6 relates to the Commissioner’s powers to obtain information for the\npurposes of discharging his or her functions. This can include the identity\ninformation of end‑users.\n\nClause 48 provides that the Commissioner may give written notice to an online\nservice provider to retain all relevant records relating to any alleged online\nharmful activity that is the subject of a report, or any end‑user who is the subject of\na notice under clause 52, for one year after the date of notice or any longer\nspecified period. Failure to comply with a written notice is an offence.\n\n\n-----\n\n149\n\nClause 49 confers power on the Commissioner to require by written notice any\nperson to provide, in the form and manner and within the time specified in the\nnotice, any information or document relating to any matter that the Commissioner\nmay require for the purposes of the Bill, as is within that person’s knowledge, in\nthat person’s custody or under that person’s control. Clause 49(2) sets out what\nthese purposes of the Bill are. The power conferred in this clause allows the\nCommissioner to require, amongst other things, the recipient to provide any\ninformation or document about the identity of an end‑user or their contact details.\nFailure to comply with a written notice without reasonable excuse is an offence.\n\nClause 50 clarifies that the written notice under clause 49 may be given to a\nperson (including an entity) whether or not in Singapore, or whether or not\nregistered in or operating in Singapore.\n\nClause 51 empowers the Commissioner to do all or any of the following, for the\npurposes of investigating any report made under Part 4 or any suspected offence\nunder the Bill:\n\n(a) issue a written order requiring anyone within the limits of Singapore,\nwho appears to be acquainted with any of the facts and circumstances\nof matters under the Bill, to attend before him or her, and that person\nmust attend as required;\n\n(b) examine orally any person who appears to be acquainted with the facts\nand circumstances of matters under the Bill.\n\nFailure to attend as required by an order under clause 51(1) is an offence.\n\nClause 52 provides that where the Commissioner reasonably suspects that an\nend‑user has engaged in online harmful activity by means of a prescribed online\nservice provider’s online service, the Commissioner may, by written notice,\nrequire the provider to take reasonable steps to obtain specified information of that\nend‑user that may identify or lead to the identification of that end‑user. The\nspecified information must be collected and provided to the Commissioner within\na specified time. It does not matter if the end‑user is outside Singapore.\nReasonable steps may include requiring the end‑user to provide the specified\ninformation in order to continue using some or all of the functions of the online\nservice. The clause empowers the Minister to prescribe steps or measures that if\ntaken, would constitute reasonable steps. The provider may also be required to\ninform the Commissioner of all the steps taken to obtain the specified information.\nFailure to comply with a written notice mentioned in clause 52(1) is an offence.\n\nClause 53 provides that upon receipt of an application by persons specified in\nclause 53(2) (called the applicant), the Commissioner may disclose to the\napplicant any identity information or contact details of an end‑user. The\nCommissioner may make this disclosure only if the Commissioner is satisfied\nthat the identity information or contact details relates to an end‑user whom the\nCommissioner reasonably suspects has engaged in online harmful activity in\n\n\n-----\n\n150\n\nrelation to the applicant, that the disclosure is for a prescribed purpose, and that the\napplication complies with the requirements in clause 53(3)(c). The Commissioner\nmay impose conditions on the applicant in relation to any information disclosed,\nincluding restraining the applicant from using the disclosed information for any\nunapproved purpose. Failure to comply with any condition imposed is an offence.\nThe use of the disclosed information remains subject to other prohibitions by law,\nincluding the prohibition against using the information to engage in doxxing of the\nend‑user.\n\nClause 54 makes it an offence for certain specified persons to disclose\ninformation that would not otherwise be available to him or her to any other\nperson except in the circumstances listed in clause 54(1).\n\nClause 55 provides that despite anything in the Bill, the Commissioner may\ndisclose, or authorise any specified person, to disclose information in certain\ncircumstances. The Commissioner may also disclose and publish information in\nan anonymised form relating to any report, the action taken by the Commissioner\nand the outcome of the action, for the purposes of public education and awareness.\n\nPART 7\n\nRECONSIDERATION AND APPEALS\n\nPart 7 relates to applications for reconsideration of decisions of the\nCommissioner, and appeals against decisions made on reconsideration. This\nPart does not limit the Commissioner’s ability, under clause 42 or 47, to cancel,\nvary or substitute a Part 5 direction or order following non‑compliance on his or\nher own initiative.\n\nClause 56 sets out the persons who are eligible to apply for reconsideration of\nthe Commissioner’s decision in relation to a report made under Part 4.\n\nClause 57 sets out the persons who are eligible to apply for reconsideration of\nthe Commissioner’s decision in relation to an order following non‑compliance.\n\nClause 58 sets out the procedure by which an eligible person can apply for\nreconsideration of a decision, direction, or order following non‑compliance made\nunder Part 5 (called the initial decision, direction or order). The application for\nreconsideration does not suspend the effect of the decision, direction or order to\nwhich the reconsideration application relates, unless the Commissioner decides\notherwise in any particular case.\n\nClause 59 provides for what the Commissioner must do on receiving an\napplication for reconsideration, within a reasonable time.\n\nIn making a decision under clause 59, the Commissioner may take into account\nany information or event that arises before or after the date of the making of the\ninitial decision, direction or order being reconsidered, whether or not the matter\n\n\n-----\n\n151\n\nwas included as part of the applicant’s reasons for requesting reconsideration.\nAfter an applicant has been informed of the result of the application for\nreconsideration, the applicant may not apply for a further reconsideration of that\nresult. The Commissioner may dismiss any application for reconsideration\nwithout reconsidering the initial decision, direction or order sought to be\nreconsidered, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the application is not made in\naccordance with any requirement, or is trivial, frivolous or vexatious or not made\nin good faith.\n\nClause 60 establishes an Online Safety Appeal Panel, and provides for the\nappointment of the Chairperson and members of the Appeal Panel. The\nChairperson may constitute an Online Safety Appeal Committee comprising\n3 or more members of the Panel for the purpose of determining any appeal.\n\nClause 61 sets out the persons who are eligible to appeal to the Chairperson of\nthe Appeal Panel against the Commissioner’s reconsidered decision in relation to\na report made under Part 4.\n\nClause 62 sets out the persons who are eligible to appeal to the Chairperson of\nthe Appeal Panel against the Commissioner’s reconsidered decision in relation to\nan order following non‑compliance.\n\nClause 63 sets out the procedure by which an eligible person can appeal against\nthe result of the Commissioner’s reconsidered decision. The making of an appeal\ndoes not suspend the effect of the decision, direction or order to which the appeal\nrelates, unless the Chairperson of the Appeal Panel decides otherwise in any\nparticular case.\n\nClause 64 provides that for the purpose of hearing any appeal, the Chairperson\nof the Appeal Panel is to constitute an Appeal Committee to determine the appeal,\nunless the Chairperson determines that the appeal is not made in accordance with\nany requirement, or is trivial, frivolous or vexatious or not made in good faith.\nClause 64(2) lists out what the Appeal Committee may do when determining an\nappeal. An Appeal Committee must not give or vary any order following\nnon‑compliance. After determining the appeal, the Appeal Committee must\ndocument in writing its reasons for its decision, and inform the Commissioner and\nthe appellant of its decision. In making a decision, the Appeal Committee may\ntake into account any information or event that arises before or after the date of the\nmaking of the reconsidered decision being appealed against, whether or not the\nmatter was included as part of the appellant’s reasons for appeal. In deciding an\nappeal, the Appeal Committee may consider any information or documents\nprovided or produced or obtained by the Commissioner pursuant to investigations\nconducted pursuant to the Committee’s request. An Appeal Committee may\nimmediately dismiss any appeal which it determines to be not made in accordance\nwith any requirement, or is trivial, frivolous or vexatious or not made in good\nfaith.\n\n\n-----\n\n152\n\nClause 65 sets out the powers of an Appeal Committee. In particular, the\nAppeal Committee may request any person to provide and produce information or\ndocuments as the Committee considers relevant for the purposes of the\nproceedings, and request the Commissioner to seek and receive any\ninformation under clause 24(2) or exercise any powers under clause 49 or 51\non any matter the Committee considers relevant for the purpose of the\nproceedings.\n\nClause 66 provides that members of the Appeal Committee may receive\nremuneration and allowances as determined by the Minister.\n\nClause 67 provides that no appeal proceeding before an Appeal Committee,\nand no act of the Chairperson of the Appeal Panel or any Appeal Committee\nmember is to be nullified only because of any vacancy in, or defect in the\nconstitution of the Appeal Committee, or any defect in the appointment of the\nChairperson of the Appeal Panel, or any Appeal Committee member. An appeal\nproceeding may be conducted in an asynchronous manner by exchange of written\ncorrespondence (including by means of electronic mail) with the parties.\n\nPART 8\n\nOFFENCES AND ENFORCEMENT\n\nPart 8 contains provisions on offences and enforcement.\n\nClause 68 empowers the Commissioner to serve a prescribed notice to attend\ncourt on a person whom the Commissioner has reasonable grounds for believing\nhas committed an offence under this Part.\n\nClause 69 creates offences for providing false or misleading information to the\nCommissioner, a Deputy Commissioner or an Assistant Commissioner, an\nauthorised officer, the Appeal Committee, the Appeal Panel, or any person acting\nunder their direction. It is also an offence to intentionally alter, suppress or destroy\nany document which a person has been required by these persons to provide.\n\nClause 70 provides that if the Commissioner is satisfied the recipient of a Part 5\ndirection or an order following non‑compliance fails to comply with the respective\ndirection or order, the Commissioner may publish a statement to that effect on the\nCommissioner’s official website. The Commissioner may remove the statement\nfrom the official website if the recipient has complied with the relevant direction\nor order. Such statements are protected by absolute privilege.\n\nClause 71 creates offences for non‑compliance with Part 5 directions without\nreasonable excuse.\n\nClause 72 creates offences for non‑compliance with access blocking orders and\napp removal orders without reasonable excuse.\n\n\n-----\n\n153\n\nClause 73 provides that certain duties that prevent or restrict a person from\ncomplying with a requirement of the relevant direction or order following\nnon‑compliance are not defences to an offence under clause 69, 71 or 72. An\napplication for reconsideration of or appeal against the relevant direction or order\nfollowing non‑compliance is also not a defence to an offence under those clauses.\nIt is a defence to a charge for an offence under Part 6 or this Part if the accused\nproves, on a balance of probabilities, that it was not reasonably practicable to do\nmore than what was in fact done to comply, or there was no better practicable\nmeans than what was in fact used.\n\nClauses 74 and 75 are standard provisions regarding the liability of officers of\ncorporations, unincorporated associations and partnerships which have committed\nan offence under the Bill. An officer will not be liable for certain offences\ncommitted by the officer’s corporation, unincorporated association or partnership.\nExamples of these offences are offences of non‑compliance with Part 5 directions\nunder clause 71, offences of non‑compliance with access blocking orders and app\nremoval orders under clause 72, and offences of non‑compliance with a written\nnotice that requires the provider to take reasonable steps to obtain specified\ninformation of an end‑user under clause 52.\n\nClause 76 empowers the Commissioner to specify, generally or in a particular\ncase, any remedial action for persons who have failed to comply with any\nrequirement of a direction given under Part 5. The Commissioner may also\ndetermine that person’s suitability for a remedial action and certify whether that\nperson has satisfactorily completed a remedial action. In deciding whether to\ninstitute proceedings against a person for an offence of non‑compliance with a\nPart 5 direction, the Public Prosecutor may consider any remedial action of the\nperson.\n\nClause 77 empowers the Commissioner or any person authorised in writing by\nthe Commissioner to compound offences that are prescribed as compoundable.\n\nClause 78 provides for the jurisdiction of the courts to deal with offences under\nthe Bill which are committed outside Singapore, and gives a District Court or a\nMagistrate’s Court jurisdiction to try any offence under the Bill and to impose the\nfull punishment for the offence despite the Criminal Procedure Code 2010.\n\nPART 9\n\nGENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS\n\nPart 9 contains general and miscellaneous provisions.\n\nClause 79 empowers the Minister to make regulations to provide for —\n\n(a) the manner of service of any notice, direction, order or other document\npermitted or required to be given under the Bill to be served on a\nperson or class of persons (called a specified document);\n\n\n-----\n\n154\n\n(b) the circumstances under which and time at which service of a specified\ndocument is treated as taking effect; and\n\n(c) the exceptions, modifications or adaptations to the application of any\nprovision of or under the Bill if the Commissioner is satisfied that the\nperson to be served did not have adequate notice of the service of a\nspecified document.\n\nAn affidavit or oral evidence of the Commissioner or an authorised officer as to\nthe service of any notice, direction, order or other document to be served under the\nBill is admissible as prima facie proof of service. “Document” excludes any\ndocument to be served in proceedings in court.\n\nClause 80 confers immunity from civil or criminal liability under any written\nlaw or rule of law, breach of confidence or any disciplinary action by a\nprofessional body, for anything done or omitted to be done, in good faith and with\nreasonable care and for the purpose of complying with or giving effect to any\nPart 5 direction, order following non‑compliance, or written notice under\nclause 49, 51 or 52. The clause also confers immunity on the Commissioner, a\nDeputy Commissioner or an Assistant Commissioner, an authorised officer, the\nSecretary to an Appeal Committee or the Appeal Panel or a member of an Appeal\nCommittee or the Appeal Panel or any person acting under their direction, for\nanything done or intended to be done in good faith and with reasonable care in the\nexecution or purported execution of the Bill. For the purpose of determining\nwhether such person acted in good faith and with reasonable care in respect of\nanything done or omitted to be done by the person, a court has to consider such\nmatters and circumstances, as may be prescribed by the Minister, which may differ\nfor different classes of persons.\n\nClause 81 empowers the Minister by order to exempt any online activity or\nonline harmful activity, or class of online activities or online harmful activities,\nfrom all or any provision of Parts 1 to 9.\n\nClause 82 empowers the Minister to make regulations for carrying out or\ngiving effect to Parts 1 to 9, for prescribing fees, and for any matter that is required\nto be prescribed under those Parts.\n\nPART 10\n\nONLINE HARMFUL ACTIVITIES — TORTS\n\nPart 10 provides for the statutory right to bring an action in civil proceedings in\nrespect of the various torts of causing online harmful activities. Not all the online\nharmful activities in Part 3 are the subject of statutory torts under this Part. In\nparticular, Part 10 will not create a statutory tort where the equivalent or a similar\nstatutory tort is found in the Protection from Harassment Act 2014.\n\n\n-----\n\n155\n\nClause 83 provides for the tort of intimate image abuse. A person (X) must not\nmake any communication that constitutes intimate image abuse. A victim has a\nright of action in civil proceedings in a court against X. It is a defence for X to\nprove —\n\n(a) that X’s conduct was reasonable;\n\n(b) that X had reasonable grounds to believe that the victim consented to\nthe communication of the intimate image or recording; or\n\n(c) that X did not know and had no reason to suspect that the material X\nhad communicated was an intimate image or recording.\n\nClause 84 provides for the tort of image‑based child abuse. A person (X) must\nnot make any communication that constitutes image‑based child abuse. A victim,\nwho was below 16 years of age at the time the victim was depicted in the child\nabuse image or recording in question, has a right of action in civil proceedings in a\ncourt against X. It is a defence for X to prove —\n\n(a) that X’s conduct was reasonable; or\n\n(b) that X did not know and had no reason to suspect that the material\ncommunicated was a child abuse image or recording.\n\nClause 85 provides for the tort of online impersonation. A person (X) must not\nconduct any online activity that constitutes online impersonation if the online\nactivity is likely to cause a victim harassment, alarm, distress or humiliation. A\nvictim has a right of action in civil proceedings in a court against X. It is a defence\nfor X to prove —\n\n(a) that X’s conduct was reasonable; or\n\n(b) that X had reasonable grounds to believe that the victim consented to\nthe online impersonation.\n\nUnlike clause 15, clause 85 applies only to online impersonation that is likely\nto cause a victim harassment, alarm, distress or humiliation. It does not extend to\nimpersonation that is unlikely to cause such harm, such as impersonation in a\ncommercial context. Civil remedies for such situations already exist under other\ncauses of action, for example the tort of passing off.\n\nClause 86 provides for the tort of inauthentic material abuse. A person (X) must\nnot make any communication that constitutes inauthentic material abuse by\ncommunicating material that X knew or had reasonable grounds to believe was\ninauthentic material of a victim. Avictim has a right of action in civil proceedings\nin a court against X. It is a defence for X to prove —\n\n(a) that X’s conduct was reasonable; or\n\n(b) that X had reasonable grounds to believe that the victim consented to\nthe communication of the inauthentic material.\n\n\n-----\n\n156\n\nClause 87 provides for the tort of online instigation of disproportionate harm. A\nperson (X) must not communicate a statement where certain requirements are met.\nThese requirements (in clause 87(1)(a), (b) and (c)) are the same as those in\nclause 19(1)(a), (b) and (c), except that the second requirement (in\nclause 87(1)(b)) is that the act or omission that the statement tends to instigate\nwould cause harm to the victim.\n\nA victim has a right of action in civil proceedings in a court against X. Under\nclause 87(4)(c), it is a defence for X to prove that X had acted reasonably in the\ncircumstances. In considering this defence, the court may have regard to all or any\nof the factors listed in clause 87(5). Clause 87(7) provides for exceptions for\nstatements instigating acts of core political activities, such as calling for others to\nvote for a candidate in a Presidential or Parliamentary election.\n\nClause 88 provides for the tort of incitement of violence. A person (X) must not\nmake any communication that constitutes incitement of violence against any\ngroup in Singapore. Each member of the group is a victim and has a right of action\nin civil proceedings in a court against X. It is a defence for X to prove that X’s\nconduct was reasonable.\n\nPART 11\n\nADMINISTRATORS — DUTIES AND TORTS\n\nPart 11 sets out the duties of administrators and torts in relation to certain\napplicable online harmful activities.\n\nClause 89 provides that Part 11 only applies to certain “applicable online\nharmful activities”, but not an activity the definition of which has not yet been\nbrought into operation.\n\nClause 90 prohibits persons from intentionally or knowingly (through\ndeveloping, etc. an online location) facilitating or permitting an applicable\nonline harmful activity by creating the tort of facilitating or permitting an\napplicable online harmful activity. A person (X) must not develop and maintain, or\notherwise administer an online location in a manner that facilitates or permits any\napplicable online harmful activity to be conducted at that location, intending for\nany applicable online harmful activity to be conducted or with the knowledge that\nany applicable online harmful activity is likely to be conducted. A victim of any\napplicable online harmful activity at the online location has a right of action in\ncivil proceedings in a court against X. The clause contains a list of factors that go\ntowards determining whether a person has contravened the prohibition. It is a\ndefence for the respondent to prove that the respondent’s conduct was reasonable\nin the circumstances.\n\nClause 91 imposes a duty on administrators of online locations to respond\nreasonably when notified of applicable online harmful activity that has occurred at\n\n\n-----\n\n157\n\nthe location they administer. It provides for the tort of failing to respond\nreasonably to an online harm notice. A victim of an applicable online harmful\nactivity may send an administrator of an online location an online harm notice that\nan applicable online harmful activity in relation to the victim has occurred at that\nlocation. Where an administrator (X) of an online location is sent an online harm\nnotice, the administrator has a duty to the victim to —\n\n(a) take reasonable care to assess whether the applicable online harmful\nactivity identified in the online harm notice has occurred; and\n\n(b) if so, take reasonable steps to address that applicable online harmful\nactivity.\n\nAn online harm notice must identify the online harmful activity in a way that\nsufficiently allows the administrator to address that activity, and be sent in such\nmanner and form, and contain such particulars as may be prescribed. The victim\nhas a right of action in civil proceedings in a court against the administrator if the\nadministrator has contravened clause 91(3). The clause contains a list of factors\nthat go towards determining what steps are reasonable for the administrator to take\nto address the applicable online harmful activity. Clause 91(6) provides for a\nrebuttable presumption to facilitate proof that the administrator failed to take\nreasonable steps. It is a defence for the administrator to prove that, through no\nfault of the administrator, the administrator did not receive the online harm notice.\n\nClause 92 provides for the tort of sending frivolous or false online harm notices\nto administrators. An administrator (X) has a right of action in civil proceedings in\na court against Z if Z sent an online harm notice to X that is frivolous, or if Z knew\nthe online harm notice is false in a material way.\n\nPART 12\n\nONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS — DUTIES AND TORTS\n\nPart 12 sets out the duties of online service providers and torts in relation to\napplicable online harmful activities.\n\nClause 93 provides that Part 12 only applies to certain “applicable online\nharmful activities”, but not an activity the definition of which has not yet been\nbrought into operation.\n\nClause 94 imposes a duty on online service providers to respond reasonably\nwhen notified of an applicable online harmful activity that has occurred by means\nof their online service. It provides for the tort of failing to respond reasonably to an\nonline harm notice. A victim of an applicable online harmful activity may send an\nonline service provider an online harm notice that an applicable online harmful\nactivity in relation to the victim has occurred by means of the online service.\nWhere an online service provider (X) is sent an online harm notice that a relevant\n\n\n-----\n\n158\n\nonline harmful activity has been conducted by means of the online service, X has a\nduty to —\n\n(a) take reasonable care in assessing whether the applicable online\nharmful activity identified in the notice has occurred; and\n\n(b) if so, take reasonable steps to address that applicable online harmful\nactivity.\n\nWhere X is a prescribed online service provider, X must comply with X’s duty\nwithin the prescribed period of time. Where X is not a prescribed online service\nprovider, X must comply with X’s duty within a reasonable time. If the prescribed\nservice provider fails to take reasonable steps to address the online harmful\nactivity within the prescribed time, it would have contravened its duty, unless it\nshows that it was not reasonable to take such steps within the prescribed time.\n\nThe victim has a right of action in civil proceedings in a court against X where\n_X has contravened clause 94(3)._\n\nThe clause sets out a list of factors that go towards determining whether X has\nfulfilled X’s duty. There is also a rebuttable presumption to facilitate proof that X\nfailed to take the reasonable steps to address the applicable online harmful activity.\nWhere X responded to an online harm notice in accordance with any applicable\nprescribed requirements, X is deemed to have fulfilled X’s duty. The fact that X did\nnot respond to an online harm notice in accordance with the prescribed\nrequirements does not, without more, lead to the conclusion that X failed to\nfulfil X’s duty.\n\nIt is a defence for X to prove that, through no fault of X, X did not receive the\nonline harm notice.\n\nClause 95 provides for the tort of sending frivolous or false online harm notices\nto online service providers. An online service provider (X) has a right of action in\ncivil proceedings in a court against Z if Z sent an online harm notice to X that is\nfrivolous or if Z knew the online harm notice was false in a material way.\n\nPART 13\n\nDAMAGES AND REMEDIES\n\nPart 13 relates to damages and remedies in relation to statutory torts.\n\nClause 96 provides that in any proceedings brought under Part 10, 11 or 12, the\ncourt may award any damages as the court may, having regard to all the\ncircumstances of the case, think just and equitable. Without limiting the damages\nthat the court may award, the court can make an order or award for —\n\n\n-----\n\n159\n\n(a) damages for loss of future earnings, and loss of earning capacity, in\nproceedings brought under torts or online harmful activities specified\nin regulations; and\n\n(b) an account of profits, even if no loss or harm is proved, in proceedings\nbrought under torts or online harmful activities specified in\nregulations.\n\nThis means that such damages can expressly be made available by regulations\nin relation to one or more torts and one or more types of online harmful activities.\nThe damages that a court may award is subject to maximum and minimum limits\nthat may be specified in regulations. These limits may be specified in relation to\none or more torts and in relation to one or more types of online harmful activities.\n\nClause 97 provides that in any proceedings brought under Part 10, 11 or 12 in\nrelation to the online harmful activity of inciting violence, damages may be\nawarded to members of the group. These damages are to be allocated and\ndistributed in accordance with procedures that may be prescribed in Rules of\nCourt. Where it is not possible or practical to do so, the court may order that the\ndamages be applied to purposes and activities that will fulfil the objectives of the\ngroup or otherwise for its benefit.\n\nClause 98 allows the court to award enhanced damages to the victim of a tort\nunder clauses 83 to 88 and 90 if the court thinks it just and equitable in the\ncircumstances to do so. These pertain to respondents who have engaged in online\nharmful activity against the victim, or who have intentionally or knowingly\nfacilitated or permitted such activity at the online location developed and\nmaintained, or otherwise administered by them, and who persist in their conduct\ndespite the victim’s request. Enhanced damages may be awarded where the victim\nmade a reasonable written request the effect of which is to ask the respondent to\naddress the online harmful activity, and the respondent failed, without reasonable\nexcuse, to do so within a reasonable time. The award of enhanced damages is in\naddition to any general and special damages that may be awarded. The award is\ndistinct from punitive or aggravated damages and the principles governing the\naward of those damages need not apply to an award of enhanced damages. The\naward of enhanced damages also may, in the court’s discretion, be awarded in\naddition to or in lieu of any punitive or aggravated damages. The Minister may\nmake regulations to prescribe the maximum limits of enhanced damages that a\ncourt may award. Regulations may also clarify the application of the Limitation\nAct 1959 to a claim for enhanced damages.\n\nClause 99 provides that the court may, in any proceedings brought under\nPart 10, 11 or 12, grant any relief or remedy against the respondent, that the court\nmay, having regard to the circumstances of the case, think just and equitable.\nClause 99(2), (3) and (4) each set out a non‑exhaustive list of injunctive reliefs that\nthe court may order in any civil proceedings brought under Part 10, 11 or 12\nrespectively.\n\n\n-----\n\n160\n\nClause 100 provides for orders for injunctive relief that the court may make\nagainst third parties in proceedings brought under Part 10, 11 or 12. These orders\nmay generally be made where it is likely that the offending material in those\nproceedings will continue to be communicated or any similar material will be\nlikely to be communicated.\n\nPART 14\n\nJURISDICTIONAL, PROCEDURAL AND\nMISCELLANEOUS MATTERS\n\nPart 14 contains jurisdictional, procedural and miscellaneous provisions.\n\nClause 101 clarifies that for the purposes of any proceedings for a tort under\nPart 10, 11 or 12, the tort is to be treated as having taken place in Singapore if any\nact or omission or any part of an act or omission that is an element of the tort was\ninitiated or occurred in or from Singapore, is perceived by one or more persons in\nSingapore, or caused damage, loss or harm suffered in Singapore.\n\nClause 102 provides that the Bill has effect despite any term to the contrary in\nany contract, agreement or notice, and any term in a contract, agreement or notice\nis void if and to the extent that —\n\n(a) it is inconsistent with Part 11 or 12;\n\n(b) it purports to exclude or limit the jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore\nfor a claim made under Part 11 or 12; or\n\n(c) it purports to prevent a person from making a claim under Part 11 or\n12.\n\nThe clause seeks to prevent in the public interest the avoidance or contracting\nout of liability under Part 11 or 12 or the circumvention or exclusion of the\njurisdiction of Singapore courts over claims under Part 11 or 12. The public policy\nconsideration is to allow victims of online harmful activity ready recourse to\navailable remedies in Singapore courts.\n\nThe clause does not apply to a provision or a term of a contract, agreement or\nnotice that is fair and reasonable having regard to the circumstances which were,\nor ought reasonably to have been, known to or in the contemplation of the parties\nwhen the contract, agreement or notice was made. The court is to take into\nconsideration the prescribed matters in determining whether a provision or a term\nof a contract, agreement or notice is fair and reasonable. Section 26(1) of the\nElectronic Transactions Act 2010 (which relates to the limitation of liability of\nnetwork service providers) does not apply in relation to any liability under the\nprovisions of Part 12 or 13 in relation to the liability of an online service provider.\n\n\n-----\n\n161\n\nClause 103 empowers the Minister to make regulations for carrying out or\ngiving effect to Parts 10 to 14 and for any matter that is required to be prescribed\nunder those Parts.\n\nClause 104 empowers the Rules Committee constituted under the Supreme\nCourt of Judicature Act 1969 to make Rules of Court in respect of civil\nproceedings brought under the Bill, and any matters incidental to or relating to any\nsuch procedure and practice.\n\nClause 105 empowers the Family Justice Rules Committee constituted under\nthe Family Justice Act 2014 to make Family Justice Rules in respect of civil\nproceedings brought under the Bill that are within the jurisdiction of the Family\nJustice Courts, and any matters incidental to or relating to any such procedure and\npractice.\n\nClause 106 provides that certain Part 10 proceedings may be commenced in the\nfirst instance in a Family Court, in which any related family proceedings are\npending, with the Family Court’s permission. A Family Court may grant\npermission to do so only if it is just, expeditious and economical for the disposal of\nsuch Part 10 proceedings. Clause 106(3) and (4) provide for the transfer of Part 10\nproceedings between the Family Court and the District Court or the Magistrate’s\nCourt. In general, Part 10 proceedings pending in a Family Court may be\ntransferred to a District Court or Magistrate’s Court if there is sufficient reason to\ndo so. A District Court or a Magistrate’s Court may transfer certain Part 10\nproceedings to a Family Court in which related family proceedings are pending, if\nit is just, expeditious and economical for the disposal of such proceedings.\n\nPART 15\n\nAMENDMENTS TO OTHER ACTS\n\nPart 15 contains amendments to other Acts.\n\nClause 107 inserts a new section 18A in the Defamation Act 1957, to provide\nthat the court can award enhanced damages as it thinks just and equitable, having\nregard to all the circumstances, where the claimant had made a reasonable request\nthat the defendant publish the claimant’s reply, but the defendant refused or\nneglected to do so, or the defendant published the reply in a manner that is not\nadequate or reasonable having regard to all the circumstances. It is clarified that\nthe award of enhanced damages is in addition to any general and special damages\nawarded, and is distinct from punitive damages or aggravated damages, and the\nprinciples governing the award of those damages need not apply to an award of\nenhanced damages. The new section allows the Minister to make regulations to\nprescribe the maximum limit of enhanced damages, and to clarify the application\nof the Limitation Act 1959 to an action for a claim for enhanced damages under\nthe Defamation Act 1957.\n\n\n-----\n\n162\n\nClause 108 amends section 17C of the Private Security Industry Act 2007 to\nreplace the words “indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting” with the words\n“threatening, abusive, insulting, sexual or indecent”, and to replace the words\n“alarm or distress” with the words “alarm, distress or humiliation”. This aligns the\ndefinition of harassment under the Private Security Industry Act 2007 with the\namended definitions in the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 (by clause 109).\n\nClause 109 provides that the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 is amended\nin the manner set out in the Schedule. Further details of the Schedule are provided\nbelow.\n\nClause 110 makes related amendments to the Family Justice Act 2014 —\n\n(a) to replace section 23(2B) to provide that an appeal shall lie to the\nGeneral Division of the High Court from a decision of a Family Court\nin proceedings under Part 10 of the Bill only with the permission of\nthat Family Court or the General Division of the High Court; and\n\n(b) to replace section 26(6A) to confer on the Family Court the jurisdiction\nand powers of a District Court to hear civil proceedings in relation to\nany claim or action under Part 10 of the Bill seeking relief under\nclause 99 or 100 (excluding proceedings seeking relief under\nclause 96, 97 or 98).\n\nClause 111 makes a related amendment to section 5 of the\nInfo‑communications Media Development Authority Act 2016 to allow the\nInfo‑communications Media Development Authority to establish and administer\nsystems in Singapore for the administration of the Bill and to provide\nadministrative and personnel support to the Commissioner.\n\nTHE SCHEDULE\n\nThe Schedule contains amendments to the Protection from Harassment\nAct 2014 (called the POHA) generally to align the POHA with the provisions\nof the Bill.\n\nParagraph 1 amends section 2 of the POHA to insert new definitions that are\nused in the provisions that are inserted by this Schedule. The paragraph also\nreplaces the definition of “online location” in that section.\n\nParagraph 2 amends section 3 of the POHA to provide that sexual or indecent\nwords, behaviour or communication also constitutes harassment. This recognises\nthat sexual or indecent material also constitutes harassment even if it is not\nthreatening, abusive or insulting. The paragraph also amends section 3 to provide\nthat humiliation is also a type of harm that can be caused by harassment. This\nrecognises that humiliation can be a form of harm that should not be inflicted on\nvictims. A new illustration is added.\n\n\n-----\n\n163\n\nParagraph 3 amends section 4 of the POHA to provide that sexual or indecent\nwords, behaviour or communication also constitutes harassment, and to provide\nthat humiliation is also a type of harm that can be caused by harassment. The\nparagraph also inserts new subsection (1A) to clarify that there is no contravention\nof section 4(1) of the POHA where the sexual or indecent words, behaviour or\ncommunication, has a legitimate purpose related to science, medicine, education\nor art.\n\nParagraph 4 amends section 6 of the POHA to provide that sexual words,\nbehaviour or communication also constitutes harassment.\n\nParagraph 5 amends section 7 of the POHA to provide that humiliation is also a\ntype of harm that can be caused by stalking. The paragraph also inserts new\nillustrations of an act or omission which, in particular circumstances, is one\nassociated with stalking.\n\nParagraphs 6 and 7 amend sections 8A and 8B of the POHA respectively to\nprovide that humiliation is also a type of harm that can be caused by harassment.\n\nParagraph 8 inserts a new section 11A of the POHA, to allow the court, if it\nthinks just and equitable in the circumstances, to award enhanced damages\nattributable to the online activity to the victim of a statutory tort under section 11,\nwhere the conduct that is the subject of the claim comprises wholly or partly of any\nonline activity. The court may do so where the victim made a reasonable written\nrequest to the respondent the effect of which is to ask the respondent to address the\nonline activity, and the respondent failed, without reasonable excuse, to do so\nwithin a reasonable time. The new section mirrors clause 98 of the Bill.\n\nParagraph 9 amends section 12 of the POHA to, among other things —\n\n(a) delete the word “substantially” in section 12(2B) and (2E);\n\n(b) insert a new section 12(2G) to allow the court to make a protection\norder requiring an administrator to stop an offending communication\nor an identical copy of the offending communication from being\npublished in Singapore at an online location; and\n\n(c) insert a new section 12(11) to clarify that a communication that is\nsimilar to an offending communication includes an identical\ncommunication.\n\nParagraph 10 amends section 13 of the POHA to, among other things —\n\n(a) delete the word “substantially” in section 13(1B);\n\n(b) insert a new section 13(1D) to allow the court to make an expedited\nprotection order against an administrator to stop an offending\ncommunication or an identical copy of the offending communication\nfrom being published in Singapore at an online location; and\n\n\n-----\n\n164\n\n(c) amend section 13(3A) to provide that an administrator who has been\nordered to stop the publication of a third party’s communication can\napply to the court to vary, suspend or cancel the expedited protection\norder.\n\nParagraph 11 inserts new paragraphs (f) and (g) in section 15(1) of the POHA.\n\nParagraph 12 amends section 15A of the POHA to delete the word\n“substantially” in subsection (3) and insert a new subsection (5) to clarify that\na statement that is similar to a relevant statement includes an identical statement.\n\nParagraph 13 inserts a new subsection (6) in section 15B of the POHA, to\nclarify that a statement that is substantially similar to a relevant statement includes\nan identical statement.\n\nParagraph 14 makes a technical amendment to section 15C of the POHA.\n\nParagraph 15 inserts —\n\n(a) a new section 15CA of the POHA to allow the court to make a stop\npublication (administrator) order against an administrator; and\n\n(b) a new section 15CB of the POHA to allow the court to make a\ncorrection (administrator) order against an administrator.\n\nParagraphs 16 and 17 make technical amendments to sections 15D and 16 of\nthe POHA, respectively.\n\nParagraph 18 inserts a new section 16AB of the POHA to allow the court to\nmake an interim stop publication (administrator) order.\n\nParagraph 19 makes a similar amendment to section 16B of the POHA as\nparagraph 13 makes to section 15B.\n\nParagraph 20 amends section 16BA(2)(a) of the POHA for consistency with\nsection 15D(2)(a).\n\nParagraph 21 inserts a new section 16BAA of the POHA to allow the court to\nmake an interim notification (administrator) order.\n\nParagraph 22 makes consequential amendments to section 16C.\n\nParagraph 23 makes an amendment to section 17 of the POHA that is related to\nthe amendment to section 3 regarding humiliation.\n\nParagraph 24 makes a technical amendment to section 19(2)(d) of the POHA.\n\nParagraph 25 amends section 21 of the POHA to empower the Minister to\nprescribe by order published in the Gazette classes of persons against whom\norders under sections 12(2G) and 13(1D) cannot be made.\n\n\n-----\n\n165\n\n## EXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC MONEY\n\nThis Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact\namount of which cannot at present be ascertained.\n\n\n-----\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"bill_introduction": {"type": "string", "description": "A short description of what the bill is about in no more than 2-3 sentences.

In the principal Act, after section 10, insert —\n\n “PART 3\n\n TRADE INFORMATION CERTIFICATES\n\n Issue of trade information certificates 5\n\n 10A.—(1) The Director‑General may issue any trade information certificate in respect of any goods that the Director‑General thinks appropriate.\n\n (2) Without affecting subsection (1), the Director‑General\n may authorise, for any period of time specified by the 10 Director‑General, any person to issue —\n\n (a) on application to the person, any trade information certificate of any class, description or type in respect of goods of any class, description or type;

For a period of 2 years after the date of commencement of any provision of this Act, the Minister may, by regulations, prescribe any additional provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on\n\n15 the enactment of that provision that the Minister may consider\n## necessary or expedient.\n\n EXPLANATORY STATEMENT\n\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act 1995\n(the Act) to establish a framework to regulate the issue of certificates (called trade\ninformation certificates) by persons authorised under the Act (called authorised\ncertificate issuers) that certify any one or more of the following matters in respect\nof any goods:\n\n(a) their import into, export from, transhipment in or transit through\nSingapore;\n\n(b) their manufacture, processing or production in Singapore;\n\n(c) the place of origin of the goods;\n\n(d) whether the goods are freely available for purchase in Singapore;\n\n(e) whether the goods have been subject to any change or modification of\nany kind while they are in transit in Singapore;\n\n(f) such other matter as may be prescribed.\n\nThe Bill also makes amendments to the Act to improve Singapore Customs’\noperational effectiveness in the investigation of offences under the Act.\n\n\n-----\n\n33\n\nA “trade information certificate” excludes any document certifying any of the\nmatters mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (f) in respect of any goods that is\nprescribed as not being a trade information certificate.\n\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\n\nPART 1\n\nAMENDMENT OF REGULATION\nOF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS ACT 1995\n\nClause 2 amends section 2(1) to introduce new definitions of “authorised\ncertificate issuer”, “certificate of origin”, “false trade information certificate”,\n“mobile communication device”, “non‑preferential certificate of origin”,\n“preferential certificate of origin” and “trade information certificate”.\n\nIn particular, “false trade information certificate” is a trade information\ncertificate —\n\n(a) that is purportedly issued by the Director‑General of Customs\n(Director‑General) appointed under section 4(1) of the Customs\nAct 1960, when it is not so issued;\n\n(b) that is issued in contravention of the new section 10A(4);\n\n(c) that contains any false or misleading information; or\n\n(d) in respect of which any entry has been —\n\n(i) erased or altered improperly or with intent to deceive;\n\n(ii) falsified; or\n\n(iii) otherwise tampered with.\n\nClause 3 inserts a new Part 3 (comprising new sections 10A to 10I) which\nprovides for a framework to regulate the issue of trade information certificates by\nauthorised certificate issuers under the Act.\n\nThe new section 10A provides that the Director‑General may issue any trade\ninformation certificate in respect of any goods.\n\nThe Director‑General may further authorise a person as an authorised\ncertificate issuer for a period of time —\n\n(a) to issue (upon an application by any other person to the firstmentioned\nperson) any class, description or type of trade information certificate in\nrespect of goods of any class, description or type; or\n\n(b) to issue any trade information certificate of any class, description or\ntype in respect of goods of any class, description or type that are\nmanufactured in, or to be exported or re‑exported from, Singapore by\n\n\n-----\n\n34\n\nthe firstmentioned person for the purposes of claiming a preferential\nrate of duty under such agreement or scheme as may be prescribed,\nwith a country or territory outside Singapore that provides for a\nself‑certification or self‑declaration scheme in relation to those goods.\n\nIt is an offence for a person to issue a trade information certificate of any class,\ndescription or type in respect of any goods of any class, description or type\n(whether expressly or by implication) as an authorised certificate issuer for that\nclass, description or type of trade information certificate in respect of that class,\ndescription or type of goods, unless the person is in fact such authorised certificate\nissuer. However, this prohibition does not apply in respect of any person who\nissues any trade information certificate for any goods if the person does not do so\n(whether expressly or by implication) as an authorised certificate issuer, whether\nor not for that trade information certificate or in respect of those goods.\n\nThe new section 10B provides for applications to the Director‑General for or to\nrenew an authorisation of a person as an authorised certificate issuer. The\nDirector‑General must not allow an application unless he or she is satisfied that the\napplicant is a fit and proper person to be an authorised certificate issuer of the\nclass, description or type of trade information certificate in respect of the class,\ndescription or type of goods, to which the application relates. In determining\nwhether an applicant is a fit and proper person for the aforesaid purpose, the\nDirector‑General may consider (among other matters) whether the applicant has\ncontravened, or is reasonably suspected of having contravened, any provision of\nthe Act or any regulations made under the Act, and (in the case of an application to\nrenew an authorisation) whether the applicant has breached any condition\nimposed on the applicant under the new section 10C.\n\nThe new section 10C empowers the Director‑General, in granting an\nauthorisation to any person as an authorised certificate issuer, to impose any\ncondition that the Director‑General thinks fit. The Director‑General may modify,\nremove or add conditions of an authorisation. However, the Director‑General may\nonly modify or add conditions of an authorisation after observing the due process\nset out in the new section 10C.\n\nThe new section 10D empowers the Director‑General to cancel or suspend the\nauthorisation of an authorised certificate issuer (called regulatory action) if the\nDirector‑General is satisfied, among other things, that the authorised certificate\nissuer is contravening or not complying with, or has contravened or failed to\ncomply with any of the conditions of its authorisation, or any provision of the Act\nor regulations made under the Act.\n\nThe Director‑General must observe the due process set out in the new\nsection 10D before taking any regulatory action against the authorised certificate\nissuer.\n\n\n-----\n\n35\n\nThe new section 10E penalises an authorised certificate issuer who issues a\ntrade information certificate containing any information which the authorised\ncertificate issuer knows or ought reasonably to know is false or misleading.\n\nThe new section 10F penalises a person who improperly or with intent to\ndeceive, erases or alters, or falsifies, or otherwise tampers with, any entry in a\ntrade information certificate.\n\nThe new section 10G penalises a person who represents either of the following\nwhile knowing or having reason to believe that the representation is false:\n\n(a) that a trade information certificate in respect of any goods is one that is\nissued by —\n\n(i) the Director‑General;\n\n(ii) an authorised certificate issuer; or\n\n(iii) an authorised certificate issuer who is authorised to issue that\nclass, description or type of trade information certificate in\nrespect of that class, description or type of goods;\n\n(b) that a trade information certificate (whether or not issued by the\nDirector‑General or an authorised certificate issuer) is issued in respect\nof goods other than the goods for which it is issued.\n\nThe new section 10H makes clear that nothing in the new Part 3 prevents any\nmanufacturer or exporter (Z) from issuing (on Z’s own account and not as an\nauthorised certificate issuer) any preferential certificate of origin in respect of any\nof Z’s goods for export or re‑export from Singapore pursuant to a preferential tariff\narrangement or agreement of which Singapore is a party. Z is required to maintain\nproper and accurate records of all preferential certificates of origin that Z issues,\nincluding copies of the documents that were relied on for the issue of those\ncertificates. The records must be maintained for the period that is specified in the\npreferential tariff arrangement or agreement. If Z fails to maintain the records, or\nto provide such records to the Director‑General on the Director‑General’s\nrequirement, Z commits an offence. It is also an offence for Z to issue a\npreferential certificate of origin containing any information which Z knows or\nought reasonably to know is false or misleading.\n\nThe new section 10I confers on the Minister the power to make regulations to\ngive effect to the new Part 3.\n\nClause 4 inserts a new Part heading to designate certain sections after the new\nsection 10I (namely, sections 11 to 39) as Part 4 of the Act entitled “Enforcement\nand Monitoring Compliance”.\n\nClause 5 amends section 11 to insert a new subsection (1A) to require a person\nto whom a trade information certificate is issued by the Director‑General or a\nperson purportedly as the Director‑General or an authorised certificate issuer or a\n\n\n-----\n\n36\n\nperson purportedly as such authorised certificate issuer, to produce the trade\ninformation certificate on demand to any authorised officer. A consequential\namendment is also made to the section heading arising from the new\nsubsection (1A).\n\nClause 6 amends section 12(1) to extend the power of seizure of a senior\nauthorised officer to the seizing of any goods in any place in respect of which he or\nshe has reasonable grounds for believing that a false trade information certificate\nhas been issued.\n\nIn addition, clause 6 amends section 12 to insert a new subsection (2A) to allow\na senior authorised officer to seize any cash that affords any evidence of the\ncommission of any offence under the Act or any regulations made under the Act or\na breach of the provisions of the Act or any regulations made under the Act if he or\nshe has reasonable cause to suspect that this is the case.\n\nClause 7 amends section 17(1) to enable the enforcement powers mentioned in\nsection 17(2) to be exercised in respect of any package, box, chest or other article\nin Singapore where a reasonable suspicion exists that it contains goods in respect\nof which a false trade information certificate has been issued.\n\nClause 8 amends section 18(1) to enable the enforcement powers mentioned in\nsection 18(2) to be exercised in respect of any goods in Singapore, where there is\nreason to believe that a false trade information certificate has been issued in\nrespect of the goods.\n\nClause 9 amends section 20(1) to enable a senior authorised officer to open and\nexamine any package, where he or she has reason to suspect that any particulars,\ninformation or document that refers to the package and is provided under any\nregulations made under the new section 10I is inaccurate, or a false trade\ninformation certificate has been issued in respect of the package.\n\nClause 10 replaces subsection (1) of section 22 and inserts a new\nsubsection (1A) to expand the things which a senior authorised officer is\n(under a warrant issued by a Magistrate) empowered to search for, and take\npossession of, on entering any dwelling house, shop or other building or place, to\ninclude the following:\n\n(a) goods or property as to which any offence under the Act or any\nregulations made under the Act has been committed;\n\n(b) books, records, documents or other articles that relate to any\ntransaction or dealing in any goods or property liable to forfeiture\nunder the Act or mentioned in paragraph (a);\n\n(c) books, records, documents or other articles that relate to any false trade\ninformation certificate;\n\n\n-----\n\n37\n\n(d) any computers or associated devices, or mobile communication\ndevices, containing or to which is available any data relating to any\ntransaction or dealing in any of the goods or property liable to\nforfeiture under the Act or mentioned in paragraph (a);\n\n(e) any cash that may afford evidence as to the commission of an offence\nunder the Act or any regulations made under the Act.\n\nThe new subsection (1A) also enables a senior authorised officer to, among\nother things —\n\n(a) inspect the operation of, and any data contained in or available to,\ncertain computers or associated devices or mobile communication\ndevices;\n\n(b) make copies of, or take extracts from, certain books, records,\ndocuments or other articles or data; and\n\n(c) preserve the computers or associated devices or mobile\ncommunication devices mentioned in paragraph (a), the books,\nrecords, documents or articles mentioned in paragraph (b) or cash\nthat may afford evidence as to the commission of an offence under the\nAct or any regulations made under the Act.\n\nClause 11 replaces section 23 to allow a senior authorised officer to enter and\nsearch premises and exercise the powers specified in section 22 or 24 without\nobtaining a search warrant under section 22 when the senior authorised officer has\nprobable cause to believe that anything that may be seized under section 22 may\nbe found in those premises and he or she has reasonable grounds to believe that, by\nreason of any delay in obtaining a search warrant, that thing is likely to be\nremoved.\n\nClause 12 replaces section 24 and inserts new sections 24A and 24B.\n\nThe new section 24 allows a senior authorised officer (O) to inspect a computer\nor associated device found in a dwelling house, shop or other building or place in\nconnection with the exercise of a power under section 22 or 23. O may require\nreasonable assistance from the person by whom or on whose behalf the computer\nor associated device is used or has been used, or from any person in charge of or\nwho operates the computer or associated device.\n\nIn addition, O may, without payment, make copies of or take extracts from any\ndata contained in or available to the computer or associated device, and may take\npossession of the computer or associated device in specified circumstances.\n_O may also take onto the premises any equipment and material, and operate any_\nelectronic equipment on the premises, for the purpose of exercising any power\nunder the new section 24.\n\n\n-----\n\n38\n\nUnder the new section 24A, any authorised officer may inspect any computer\nor associated device which is or has been in use in connection with any particulars,\ninformation or document to which certain provisions refer. The authorised officer\nmay require reasonable assistance from the person by whom or on whose behalf\nthe computer or associated device is used or has been used, or from any person in\ncharge of or who operates the computer or associated device.\n\nUnder the new section 24B, sections 370, 371 and 372 of the Criminal\nProcedure Code 2010 (relating to the procedure governing the seizure of property\nby a law enforcement officer) apply to the seizure of computers or associated\ndevices, mobile communication devices or cash under the Act.

For a period of 2 years after the date of publication in the Gazette of the Finance (Income Taxes) Act 2025, the Minister may, by regulations, prescribe such provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of any provision of that Act as\n\n20 the Minister may consider necessary or expedient, and such\n## regulations may be made to operate retrospectively to a date no earlier than the commencement of the provision.\n\n EXPLANATORY STATEMENT\n\nThis Bill seeks to implement the tax changes in the Government’s 2025 Budget\nStatement in the Income Tax Act 1947 (called the ITA), and to make certain other\namendments to the ITA. This Bill also seeks to amend the Multinational Enterprise\n(Minimum Tax) Act 2024 (called the MMTA) in accordance with various\nprovisions of (and guidances on) the GloBE Model Rules, and to give effect to\nvarious guidances in the document entitled “Tax Challenges Arising from the\nDigitalisation of the Economy ‑ Administrative Guidance on the Global Anti‑Base\nErosion Model Rules (Pillar 2), June 2024” published by the Organisation for\n\n\n-----\n\n109\n\nEconomic Co‑operation and Development (OECD) on 17 June 2024 (called the\nJune 2024 AG). The Bill also makes a related amendment to the Goods and\nServices Tax Act 1993.\n\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\n\nPART 1\n\nAMENDMENT OF\nINCOME TAX ACT 1947\n\nPart 1 makes amendments to various provisions of the ITA.\n\nClause 2 amends section 2 (Interpretation) —\n\n(a) to insert a new definition for the term “renewable energy” (used in the\namended sections 13A, 13E, 13P and 43U) which comprises the\ndifferent types of power specified in the existing definition of\n“offshore renewable energy” but without referring to any such\npower being generated offshore; and\n\n(b) to provide that a ship is used for renewable energy activity if it is used\nfor the subsea distribution, exploration or exploitation of renewable\nenergy.\n\nThese amendments are made because with effect from 19 February 2025,\nincome derived from certain activities connected with a ship used for distribution\n(via sea), exploration or exploitation of renewable energy (whether generated\nonshore or offshore) may qualify for tax exemption under section 13A, 13E or\n13P.\n\nClause 3 amends section 2A (Purpose of Act) to provide that the new\nsections 92K, 92L, 93AA and 93C apply only to taxes imposed under the ITA but\nnot to taxes imposed under the MMTA.\n\nClause 4 amends section 10 (Charge of income tax) in relation to the tax\ntreatment of gains or profits derived by a foreign individual from a right or benefit\nto acquire shares in a company because of his or her employment in Singapore.\n\nCurrently, if the individual ceases employment in Singapore and the right or\nbenefit to acquire the shares has not been exercised, assigned, released or acquired\nby him or her, or the restriction on sale of such shares has not ceased to apply,\nsection 10(7) provides that the deemed gains or profits are to be computed based\non the price of the shares in the open market one month before the date of\ncessation of employment or the grant of the right or benefit (whichever is later).\n\nThe new section 10(7AA) provides that if within 5 years after the year in which\nthe individual ceases employment in Singapore or the right or benefit is granted —\n\n\n-----\n\n110\n\n(a) the individual exercises, assigns, releases or acquires the right or\nbenefit, or the restriction on the sale of the shares ceases to apply;\n\n(b) the actual gains or profits derived are lower than what was deemed\nunder section 10(7); and\n\n(c) the individual makes an application under the new section 10(7AC),\n\nthen the individual’s gains or profits from the right or benefit are to be\nre‑computed in accordance with section 10(6), and treated as income derived on\nthe date that the individual ceases employment in Singapore or the right or benefit\nis granted, and is chargeable to tax.\n\nThe new section 10(7AB) provides that the tax treatment in section 10(7) does\nnot apply if —\n\n(a) within 5 years after the year in which the individual ceases\nemployment in Singapore or the right or benefit is granted, his or\nher right or benefit to acquire the shares lapses, or is forfeited or\ncancelled; and\n\n(b) he or she makes an application under the new section 10(7AC).\n\nUnder the new section 10(7AC), the individual mentioned in the new\nsection 10(7AA) or (7AB) may apply to the Comptroller to revise any\nassessment made in respect of the gains or profits derived from the right or\nbenefit within 5 years after the year in which he or she ceases employment in\nSingapore or the right or benefit is granted.\n\nClause 5 amends section 13 (Exempt income) to exempt from tax the following\npayments received by an individual for attending any course that is eligible for the\nrespective payments:\n\n(a) the Workfare Training Support Training Allowance made under the\nWorkfare Training Support scheme, or any payment made under any\npublic scheme that succeeds or replaces that scheme;\n\n(b) the SkillsFuture Mid‑Career Training Allowance made under the\nSkillsFuture Level‑Up Programme;\n\n(c) the Workfare Skills Support (Level‑Up) Full Time Training Allowance\nmade under the Workfare Skills Support (Level‑Up) scheme.\n\nThe tax exemption mentioned in paragraph (a) is backdated to take effect from\n(and including) 1 January 2013. The public scheme mentioned in paragraph (a)\nwas replaced by the Workfare Skills Support scheme with effect from 2020, which\nwas in turn replaced by the Workfare Skills Support (Basic) scheme with effect\nfrom 11 March 2025.\n\nThe exemption mentioned in paragraph (b) is for payment for a course\nspecified on an Internet website (that is either prescribed or accessible from a\n\n\n-----\n\n111\n\nprescribed Internet website) on the later of the date of commencement of the\ncourse and 10 March 2025.\n\nNext, clause 5 exempts from tax any payment received by an individual under\nthe public scheme known as the Workforce Singapore’s SkillsFuture Jobseeker\nSupport scheme and any contribution to the Central Provident Fund in respect of\nan individual made by the Government under the Earn and Save Bonus (ESB) that\nis part of the public scheme known as the Majulah Package.\n\nNext, clause 5 amends section 13 to empower the Minister to make a\nnotification under subsection (4) to provide that any qualifying payment that is\nmade by an approved shipping financing arrangement enterprise to a non‑resident\nperson is exempt from tax. Approval of a shipping financing arrangement\nenterprise for the purpose of the exemption may be granted from 1 January 2025 to\n31 December 2031 and is for a period not exceeding 5 years as specified by the\nMinister or an authorised body, subject to any extension. Such notification may be\nbackdated to 1 January 2025.\n\nNext, clause 5 amends section 13 to extend the date (from 1 January 2026 to\n1 January 2031) after which a tax exemption order made under section 13(12) for\nforeign‑sourced income received in Singapore by the trustee of a real estate\ninvestment trust (REIT), the trustee of a sub‑trust of a REIT or a wholly‑owned\nsubsidiary of the trustee of a REIT, will only apply to certain income as described\nin section 13(12A) and (12B).\n\nNext, clause 5 amends section 13(12A)(c) to remove the requirement that a\nwholly‑owned subsidiary of the trustee of a REIT must be incorporated in\nSingapore. This is so that an order in subsection (12A) can apply on or after\n1 January 2031 to exempt income received by such subsidiary that is not\nincorporated in Singapore.\n\nNext, clause 5 inserts a new section 13(14) to allow any order made under\nsection 13(12) in relation to certain foreign‑sourced income received in Singapore\nby a company resident in Singapore, the share capital of which is 100% owned by\nthe trustee of a REIT, to be backdated to 19 February 2025. This is for the purpose\nof backdating the commencement date for the removal of the requirement under\nthe Income Tax (Exemption of Foreign Income — REITs and Other Special\nCases) Order 2006 (G.N. No. S 435/2006) that the company must be incorporated\nin Singapore for its foreign‑sourced income received in Singapore to be exempt\nfrom tax.\n\nThe new section 13(14) also enables the making of other amendments to that\nOrder to exempt from tax, with effect from 19 February 2025, certain income\nderived from the direct holding of immovable property situated outside Singapore\nthat is received in Singapore by certain persons under that Order.\n\nLastly, clause 5 inserts a new section 13(14A) to allow an order made under\nsection 13(12) in relation to foreign‑sourced income received in Singapore by a\n\n\n-----\n\n112\n\nperson resident in Singapore that is connected with any loan taken or debt\nsecurities issued for the purpose of acquiring, developing, investing in, owning or\noperating an offshore infrastructure asset or project, to take effect from (and\nincluding) 1 January 2026.\n\nClause 6 amends section 13A (Exemption of shipping profits) to provide that\nthe income of a shipping enterprise derived from the mobilisation or holding of\nships used for any renewable energy activity carried out on or after 19 February\n2025 is exempt from tax. Such income includes income derived on or after that\ndate from foreign exchange and risk management activities carried out in\nconnection with and incidental to such activity. Consequential amendments are\nmade to the definitions of “holding”, “mobilisation” and “operation” in\nsection 13A(16).\n\nClause 6 also amends section 13A(3) to ringfence a loss incurred from any\nforeign exchange and risk management activities that are carried out in connection\nwith and incidental to the finance leasing of a Singapore ship for use outside the\nport limits of Singapore, so that the loss may only be deducted against income\nderived from certain tax‑exempt activities in that section.\n\nClause 7 amends section 13E (Exemption of international shipping profits) to\nexempt from tax the income of an approved international shipping enterprise\nderived on or after 19 February 2025 from the operation outside the port limits of\nSingapore of a foreign ship for renewable energy activity. Income derived from\nthe chartering of a foreign ship used for renewable energy activity outside the port\nlimits of Singapore, and the mobilisation or holding of any ship used for\nrenewable energy activity outside the port limits of Singapore, among others, is\nalso exempt from tax with effect from that date.\n\nClause 7 also amends section 13E(2A) to extend (till 31 December 2031) the\nlast date on which an approval of an approved international shipping enterprise\nmay be granted for the tax incentive under the section.\n\nNext, clause 7 amends section 13E(4) and (4A) to ringfence any loss incurred\nby an approved international shipping enterprise from certain newly incentivised\nactivities, so that the loss may only be deducted against income derived from\ncertain activities incentivised under that section.\n\nNext, clause 7 amends the definition of “qualifying special purpose vehicle” in\nsection 13E(7) to remove the requirement in paragraph (7)(a)(i) and (d)(i) that it\nmust be incorporated in Singapore.\n\nFinally, clause 7 amends section 13E to exempt from tax the income of an\napproved international shipping enterprise derived on or after the date of\ncommencement of clause 7(2)(c) of the Bill from foreign exchange and risk\nmanagement activities carried out in connection with and incidental to the\nprovision of prescribed ship management services to certain persons. Loss from\n\n\n-----\n\n113\n\nsuch activity is also ringfenced, so that it may only be deducted against income\nderived from certain incentivised activities in that section.\n\nClause 8 amends section 13P (Exemption of income of shipping investment\nenterprise) to provide that with effect from 19 February 2025, income derived\nfrom the chartering or finance leasing of a seagoing ship that is acquired by an\napproved shipping investment enterprise or its approved related party by way of a\nfinance lease entered into with an entity that is not an approved related party is\nexempt from tax, if the seagoing ship is treated as sold under section 10C.\n\nClause 8 also amends section 13P to extend (till 31 December 2031) the last\ndate on which a shipping investment enterprise or its related parties may be\napproved for a tax incentive under that section.\n\nFinally, clause 8 amends section 13P(4) to enable a tax exemption period not\nexceeding 40 years to be specified for certain ships used for renewable energy\nactivity (as defined in the amended section 2).\n\nClause 9 amends section 13U (Exemption of income arising from funds\nmanaged by fund manager in Singapore) to expand the meaning of “eligible SPV”,\nin relation to a master‑feeder fund‑SPV structure or a master fund‑SPV structure,\nto include a prescribed international organisation or an approved international\norganisation under section 13V, as an investor of the SPV.\n\nClause 10 amends section 13W (Exemption of gains or profits from disposal of\nordinary shares) to extend, with effect from 1 January 2026, the tax exemption in\nthat section to any gains or profits derived by a company (called the divesting\ncompany) from the disposal of preference shares (which are accounted for as\nequity) in another company (called the investee company). The tax exemption is\nalso extended with effect from that date to any such gains or profits if the divesting\ncompany, together with one or more companies in the same group, owns ordinary\nshares or preference shares (or both) of a prescribed percentage or value at the start\nof a 24‑month period before the disposal (called group basis of assessment). Only\ngains from the disposal of shares owned by the divesting company at that start date\nqualify for the exemption under the group basis of assessment. For the purpose of\nthe group basis of assessment, shares are treated as disposed of on a\nfirst‑in‑first‑out basis.\n\nClause 11 amends section 14 (Deductions allowed) to make amendments to\nupdate terminology of certain terms, similar to the amendments made in\nsection 14G.\n\nClause 11 also amends section 14 to provide that a person who is allowed a\ndeduction under the new section 14ZJ for qualifying expenditure in relation to any\ngreen certificates or green credits is not allowed a deduction for the same\nexpenditure under section 14.\n\n\n-----\n\n114\n\nClause 12 amends subsection (2AA) of section 14B (Further deduction for\nexpenses relating to approved trade fairs, exhibitions or trade missions,\nmaintenance of overseas trade office, or electronic commerce) to extend the\nperiod (till 31 December 2030) in which certain expenses mentioned in\nsubsection (2) that are incurred by a firm or company for the primary purpose\nof promoting the trading of goods or the provision of services are allowed a\ndeduction despite the firm or company not being an approved firm or approved\ncompany.\n\nNext, clause 12 amends subsection (2AB) of section 14B to extend the period\n(till 31 December 2030) in which a firm or company resident in Singapore or has a\npermanent establishment in Singapore may incur certain expenses for the primary\npurpose of promoting the trading of goods or provision of services, to enjoy a\nfurther deduction of the amount of such expenses (in addition to the deduction\nunder section 14).\n\nFinally, clause 12 amends section 14B(12) to extend (till 31 December 2030)\nthe last date on which a firm or company may be approved for the purposes of the\nsection.\n\nClause 13 inserts a new section 14EB to allow a deduction to be made for any\npayment made by a company under an innovation cost‑sharing agreement in\nrespect of any qualifying innovation activity to be carried out under the agreement,\nif the agreement is approved by the Minister or an authorised body. A “qualifying\ninnovation activity” is an activity that falls within certain categories of activities\nspecified in the “Oslo Manual 2018 — Guidelines for Collecting, Reporting and\nUsing Data on Innovation” published by the OECD.\n\nThe Minister or authorised body may impose conditions when approving an\ninnovation cost‑sharing agreement and specify the period in which any payment\nmade under the agreement is allowed a deduction (called the specified period).\nThe Minister or authorised body may approve an innovation cost‑sharing\nagreement only if the agreement provides that any benefit arising from it\naccrues wholly or partly to the company, and the company gives an undertaking\nthat the whole or a part of the qualifying innovation activity is to be carried out in\nSingapore by or on behalf of the company.\n\nA deduction under section 14EB is not allowed if benefit arising from the\nagreement does not accrue (whether wholly or partly) to the company or no\nqualifying innovation activity is carried out in Singapore by or on behalf of the\ncompany. In addition, if a company that has been allowed a deduction sells,\nassigns or disposes of any benefit that arose from the agreement during the\nspecified period, either the amount of the deduction attributable to the benefit or\nthe amount or the value of the consideration (whichever is lower) is treated as a\ntrading receipt for the company’s trade or business for the year of assessment\nrelating to the basis period in which the sale, assignment or disposal occurs.\n\n\n-----\n\n115\n\nDuring the specified period of an approved innovation cost‑sharing agreement,\na deduction in respect of any payment made by the company under the agreement\nis allowed only under the new section 14EB, and no other provision (namely\nsection 14A, 14C, 14D, 14EA, 14U or 19B).\n\nClause 14 makes technical amendments to section 14G (Provisions by banks\nand qualifying finance companies for doubtful debts and diminution in value of\ninvestments) —\n\n(a) to replace the expressions “provision for doubtful debts” and\n“provision for diminution in the value of investment in securities”\nwith “provisions for impairment losses or expected credit losses\narising from loans or investments in securities”, in order to adopt the\nterminology used in the Financial Reporting Standard 109 and\nSingapore Financial Reporting Standard (International) 9; and\n\n(b) to delete “extraordinary gain” and “extraordinary loss” in the\ndefinition of “qualifying profit” as these terms are obsolete.\n\nClause 15 amends section 14H (Further or double deduction for overseas\ninvestment development expenditure) to extend the period (till 31 December\n2030) in which certain investment development expenditure that is incurred by a\nfirm or company may be allowed a deduction, without the need for the firm or\ncompany to be approved. It also extends (till 31 December 2030) the last date that\na firm or company may be approved for the purposes of section 14H.\n\nClause 16 amends section 14M (Deduction for shares transferred by special\npurpose vehicle under employee equity‑based remuneration scheme) to simplify\nthe tax deduction rules for the transfer by a special purpose vehicle of treasury\nshares in a company (called Co X) or the holding company of Co X to an\nemployee of Co X under a stock option scheme or share award scheme, from the\nyear of assessment 2026 onwards.\n\nIf the transferred shares are treasury shares in Co X, the deduction to be\nallowed is the cost to Co X of acquiring the shares, less any amount paid or\npayable by the employee for those shares. If the transferred shares are treasury\nshares in the holding company of Co X, the deduction to be allowed is the lower\nof —\n\n(a) the amount paid or payable by Co X in respect of the transferred\nshares, less any amount paid or payable by the employee for those\nshares; and\n\n(b) the cost to the holding company of Co X of acquiring the shares, less\nany amount paid or payable by the employee for those shares.\n\nClause 17 inserts a new section 14MA to allow a deduction to a company\n(called a subsidiary) where —\n\n\n-----\n\n116\n\n(a) its holding company issues new shares to an employee of the\nsubsidiary pursuant to an employee equity‑based remuneration\nscheme; or\n\n(b) a special purpose vehicle to which new shares of the holding company\nof the subsidiary were issued, then transfers those shares to an\nemployee of the subsidiary, pursuant to an employee equity‑based\nremuneration scheme.\n\nThe deduction to be allowed is the lower of the amount paid or payable by the\nsubsidiary for those shares and the value of those shares, and is for the year of\nassessment relating to the basis period in which the shares are issued or transferred\nto the employee, or payment for the shares have become due and payable by the\nsubsidiary, whichever is later.\n\nClause 18 amends section 14X (Attribution of deductible expenses incurred\nbefore commencement of trade, etc.) to make consequential amendments arising\nfrom the enactment of the new section 14EB by clause 13.\n\nClause 19 inserts a new section 14ZJ to allow a person who surrenders any\nprescribed green certificates or green credits a deduction for qualifying\nexpenditure incurred for them in the basis period for the year of\nassessment 2026 or subsequent years of assessment. The deduction is to be\nallowed for the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the person\nsurrenders the green certificates or green credits. Qualifying expenditure includes\n(among other things) expenditure for the acquisition and surrender (or retirement)\nof the green certificates or green credits. Green certificates or green credits are\n“surrendered” or “retired” for such purposes as the offsetting of a person’s carbon\nemissions or liability for carbon tax. The Minister may make rules under section 7\nto exclude any activity from being treated as the surrendering (or retirement) of\ngreen certificates or green credits.\n\nClause 20 amends section 15 (Deductions not allowed) to allow a deduction for\nany payment made on or after 1 January 2026 by an employer on behalf of his or\nher employee to the employee’s CPF medisave account, where that payment\nconstitutes a voluntary contribution under section 13B of the Central Provident\nFund Act 1953. The amendment has effect for the year of assessment 2027 and\nsubsequent years of assessment.\n\nNext, clause 20 makes amendments to section 15 that are consequential to the\namendments to section 14M and the enactment of the new section 14EB (inserted\nby clause 13) and the new section 14MA (inserted by clause 17).\n\nClause 20 also makes a consequential amendment to section 15 arising from\nthe new section 14ZJ (inserted by clause 19).\n\nFinally, clause 20 amends section 15 to expressly disallow a deduction for any\npayment or expenditure incurred by a person that is in furtherance of, or in\n\n\n-----\n\n117\n\nconnection with, the commission of an offence under the Prevention of Corruption\nAct 1960, or certain offences under the Penal Code 1871. The offences under the\nPenal Code 1871 concern (among others) the giving or accepting of a gratification\nfor a corrupt purpose.\n\nClause 21 amends section 18C (Initial and annual allowances for certain\nbuildings and structures) to extend the last date (till 31 December 2030) in which\nan approval may be granted for any construction or renovation of a building or\nstructure on industrial land, port land or airport land, so that an allowance may be\nmade in respect of any qualifying capital expenditure incurred on the approved\nconstruction or renovation.\n\nClause 21 also reduces the percentage (from at least 75% to more than 50%) of\nthe beneficial interest in the total number of issued ordinary shares of a person\n(that is a company) or the income of a person (that is a partnership), that another\nperson must hold or be entitled to, for the persons to be treated as related to each\nother for the purposes of section 18C. This amendment applies if both the\napplication for planning permission or conservation permission and the\napplication under section 18C(1) or (1A) are made on or after 1 January 2026.\n\nClause 22 amends section 19B (Writing‑down allowances for intellectual\nproperty rights) to make a consequential amendment arising from the enactment of\nthe new section 14EB by clause 13.\n\nClause 23 amends subsection (3)(h) of section 34AA (Adjustment on change of\nbasis of computing profits of financial instruments resulting from FRS 109 or\nSFRS(I) 9) for 2 reasons:\n\n(a) section 14G (as amended by clause 14) no longer uses the term\n“doubtful debt” and instead refers to a provision for an expected credit\nloss arising from loans and investments in securities. It is therefore no\nlonger necessary to modify the application of section 14G to such\ninstruments under section 34AA(3)(h);\n\n(b) to provide that the tax treatment in section 14G of any provision by a\nbank or qualifying finance company arising from its loans and\ninvestments in securities, prevails over that in section 34AA(3)(g).\nSection 34AA(3)(g) provides that an amount of expected credit losses\nof a non‑credit‑impaired financial instrument that are recognised in\naccordance with FRS 109 or SFRS(I) 9 must be disregarded.\n\nClause 24 amends section 34CA (Transfer of businesses by insurer) to give the\nMinister or Comptroller the discretion to extend, in any particular case, the period\nbefore or after a licensed insurer (called a transferor) must transfer its\nnon‑insurance business to a transferee for the section to apply. Under the\nexisting subsection (1)(c), the transfer must take place no earlier than 12 months\nbefore, and no later than 12 months after, the transferor transfers its insurance\nbusiness to the transferee.\n\n\n-----\n\n118\n\nClause 24 also amends section 34CA to give the Minister or Comptroller the\ndiscretion to extend, beyond the prescribed date under subsection (3)(d), the date\nby which the transferor is to be wound up or dissolved for the section to apply.\n\nClause 25 amends section 34D (Transactions not at arm’s length) to provide for\nthe making of subsidiary legislation for the identification of related parties in a\ntransaction that involves a partnership, trust or registered business trust, to clarify\nhow the provision applies to such transaction.\n\nAn exception is created so that section 34D does not apply to a transaction\nwhere the related parties to that transaction are parties to a trust (i.e., the settlor,\ntrustee or beneficiary), and the trust is one which the settlor is an individual and all\nthe beneficiaries are individuals or charitable institutions, trusts or bodies of\npersons established for philanthropic purposes (as defined in section 13L(3)) only.\nSection 34D applies to a transaction entered into between a party to the trust and a\nperson that is not a party to the trust.\n\nClause 26 amends section 34F (Transfer pricing documentation) to apply the\nnew section 34D(3), (5) or (7) (as inserted by clause 25) in identifying the related\nparties to a transaction for the purposes of section 34F, where the transaction\ninvolves a partnership, trust or registered business trust.\n\nClause 27 amends section 36B (Registered business trusts) to make\nconsequential amendments arising from the amendments to section 13W by\nclause 10. Clause 27 also amends section 36B(1)(e) to modify the application of\nthe new section 92L to a registered business trust, by replacing the definitions of\n“employee” and “local employee” in section 92L(7) with another definition of\n“local employee”.\n\nFinally, clause 27 amends section 36B to modify the application of the new\nsection 92K as inserted by clause 42 to a registered business trust by treating the\nreferences in section 92K to the ordinary shares of a company as references to the\nunits in a registered business trust, and references to a wholly‑owned subsidiary as\nreferences to a company all the shares of which are held (directly or indirectly) for\na registered business trust by its trustee‑manager.\n\nClause 28 amends section 37O (Deduction for acquisition of shares of\ncompanies) to extend the last date (till 31 December 2030) on which any capital\nexpenditure incurred by a Singapore company or its subsidiary for qualifying\nacquisition of shares in another company is allowed a deduction under that\nsection.\n\nClause 29 amends section 37Q (Exclusion of expenditure or payment\nsubsidised by capital grant) to make a consequential amendment arising from\nthe enactment of the new section 14EB (inserted by clause 13).\n\nClause 30 amends section 37R (Cash payout under Enterprise Innovation\nScheme) by inserting new subsections (31A) and (31B). The new\n\n\n-----\n\n119\n\nsubsection (31A) requires any amount of cash payout to be made to an eligible\nperson under the section to be reduced by any amount recoverable by the\nComptroller from the eligible person as a debt due to the Government under\nsubsection (20), (21), (22) or (30). The amount of reduction is treated as a\nrepayment of the debt.\n\nUnder the new subsection (31B), where the amount of cash payout to be made\nto an eligible person is less than the sum of the amount of tax, etc., due from the\neligible person under subsection (28) and the amount recoverable from the eligible\nperson under subsection (20), (21), (22) or (30), the Comptroller may determine\nthe amount of reduction under subsection (28)(a) or subsection (31A)(a),\n(or both), in a manner that the Comptroller considers reasonable.\n\nClause 31 amends section 39 (Relief and deduction for resident individual) to\nexpand the scope of relief under subsection (2)(c), (d) and (ga)(i) to allow a\nwoman to claim a deduction on any payment mentioned in those provisions.\nCurrently, only a man may claim a deduction under those provisions. These\namendments have effect for the year of assessment 2026 and subsequent years of\nassessment.\n\nNext, clause 31 amends section 39 by replacing paragraph (ha) of\nsubsection (2) with new paragraphs (ha) and (haa).\n\nThe new paragraph (ha) sets out the existing relief in respect of voluntary CPF\ncontributions made in the year immediately preceding the year of assessment by a\nresident individual who carried on a trade, business, profession or vocation in that\nyear.\n\nThe new paragraph (haa) provides for a revised relief for obligatory CPF\ncontributions made by a resident individual in respect of income derived in any\nyear from a trade, business, profession or vocation. The full amount of obligatory\nCPF contributions on such income (excluding any obligatory CPF contribution on\nsuch income derived as a Group A worker) made in the year immediately\npreceding the year of assessment 2026 or any subsequent year of assessment is\nallowed as relief and is no longer subject to a cap of 37% of such income.\n\nNext, clause 31 amends section 39 to provide that tax deduction will not be\nallowed to a resident individual for an amount of cash top‑up made on or after\n1 January 2026 by the individual to his or her own or his or her spouse’s, sibling’s,\nparent’s, parent‑in‑law’s, grandparent’s or grandparent‑in‑law’s medisave\naccount. The amount is the full amount of cash top‑up in respect of which a\nmatching grant is made under the Central Provident Fund Board’s Matched\nMediSave Scheme or part of that amount prescribed by rules.\n\nNext, clause 31 amends section 39 to exclude from the deduction allowable\nunder subsection (3A) for a voluntary contribution made to the CPF medisave\naccount of an individual resident in Singapore, any amount of CPF contribution\n\n\n-----\n\n120\n\nthat is allowed a deduction under subsection (2)(ha). This amendment has effect\nfor the year of assessment 2026 and subsequent years of assessment.\n\nFinally, clause 31 makes amendments to subsections (2)(hb) and (10B) of\nsection 39 that are consequential to the other amendments to that section.\n\nClause 32 amends section 43 (Rate of tax upon companies and others) for the\nfollowing purposes:\n\n(a) to provide that tax transparency applies to co‑location income and\nco‑working space income (as defined in the amended subsection (10))\nderived by a trustee of a REIT or an approved sub‑trust of a REIT with\neffect from 1 July 2025;\n\n(b) to remove the sunset clause for the tax transparency concession for an\napproved REIT exchange‑traded fund;\n\n(c) to extend the period (till 31 December 2030) by which distributions\nfrom certain income made by the trustee of a REIT or an approved\nREIT exchange‑traded fund are subject to a concessionary tax rate of\n10%;\n\n(d) to extend the period (till 31 December 2030) by which distributions\nfrom certain income made by the trustee of a REIT or an approved\nREIT exchange‑traded fund to certain persons or entities that are\neligible for tax exemption under section 13D, 13OA, 13U or 13V are\nsubject to a concessionary tax rate of 10%.\n\nClause 32 also amends section 43(3F) which sets out the distributions to which\nsection 43(3D) and (3E) applies. Section 43(3D) and (3E) provides that in the\napplication of section 43(3B) and (3C) respectively to a distribution made out of\ncertain incomes by a trustee of a REIT or an approved REITexchange‑traded fund\nto persons described in section 43(3F) with a Singapore fund manager, that fund\nmanager is not considered a Singapore permanent establishment. Section 43(3F)\nis amended to include distributions to the following persons who are not\nSingapore residents:\n\n(a) a partner of an approved limited partnership under section 13OA;\n\n(b) a prescribed international organisation or an approved international\norganisation under section 13V.\n\nClause 33 amends section 43C (Exemption and concessionary rate of tax for\ninsurance and reinsurance business) to enable the Minister to make regulations —\n\n(a) to provide for a concessionary tax rate of 15% to apply to income\nmentioned in subsection (1)(aa) derived by an approved insurer,\nwhose approval is granted on or after 19 February 2025; and\n\n\n-----\n\n121\n\n(b) to provide for a concessionary tax rate of 15% to apply to income\nspecified under subsection (1)(c) derived by an approved captive\ninsurer, whose approval is granted on or after 19 February 2025.\n\nThe regulations for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) may be made to take\nwith effect from (and including) 1 January 2025.\n\nClause 34 amends section 43J (Concessionary rate of tax for financial sector\nincentive company) to enable the Minister to make regulations to provide for —\n\n(a) a concessionary rate of tax of 15% on income from prescribed\nqualifying activities derived on or after 1 January 2025 by a financial\nsector incentive company that is approved on or after 19 February\n2025;\n\n(b) tax exemption on income from prescribed qualifying activities derived\non or after 19 February 2025 by a financial sector incentive company;\nand\n\n(c) a concessionary rate of tax of 5% on income from prescribed\nqualifying activities derived on or after 19 February 2025 by a\nfinancial sector incentive company that becomes listed, or whose\nholding company becomes listed, on a Singapore stock exchange on or\nafter that date, among other conditions.\n\nIn relation to the tax incentives mentioned in paragraphs (b) and (c), the\nMinister or authorised body may at the time of approving a company, provide that\nif any specified requirement is not satisfied in a basis period or throughout a basis\nperiod for any year of assessment, the tax incentive will not apply for that year of\nassessment, or for that year of assessment and each subsequent year of assessment.\n\nIn relation to the tax incentive mentioned in paragraph (c) —\n\n(a) it is a condition of approval for the financial sector incentive company\n(called X) or its holding company to remain listed on the Singapore\nstock exchange throughout the period of X’s approval; and\n\n(b) X or its holding company must not be an approved company under\nsection 92K(6), or an approved nominee under section 92K(15)(a),\n(16) or (22).\n\nIn a case where it is a condition of approval for X that its holding company\nremains listed on the Singapore stock exchange, a delisting by the holding\ncompany during that period is treated as a failure by X to comply with its condition\nof approval under section 105R (Revocation of approval).\n\nThe new subsection (3) provides that regulations made for the purposes of the\ntax incentive mentioned in paragraph (a) may take effect from 1 January 2025.\nThe new subsection (4) provides that regulations made for the purposes of the tax\n\n\n-----\n\n122\n\nincentive mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c) may take effect from 19 February\n2025.\n\nClause 35 amends section 43L (Concessionary rate of tax for shipping\ninvestment manager) to extend till 31 December 2031, the last date on which a\nshipping investment manager may be approved for a tax incentive under the\nsection.\n\nClause 36 amends section 43P (Concessionary rate of tax for container\ninvestment enterprise) to provide that with effect from 19 February 2025, income\nderived from the leasing of a container or intermodal equipment that is acquired by\nan approved container investment enterprise or its approved related party by way\nof a finance lease with an entity that is not an approved related party is subject to a\nconcessionary rate of tax of 5% or 10%, if the container or intermodal equipment\nis treated as sold under section 10C.\n\nClause 36 also amends section 43P to extend till 31 December 2031, the last\ndate on which a container investment enterprise or its related parties may be\napproved for a tax incentive under that section.\n\nClause 37 amends section 43Q (Concessionary rate of tax for container\ninvestment manager) to extend till 31 December 2031, the last date on which a\ncontainer investment manager may be approved for a tax incentive under that\nsection.\n\nClause 38 amends section 43R (Concessionary rate of tax for approved\ninsurance brokers) to enable the Minister to make regulations for specified income\nderived by an approved insurance broker that is approved between 19 February\n2025 and 31 December 2028 (both dates inclusive) to be subject to a\nconcessionary rate of tax of 15%, to take effect from 1 January 2025.\n\nClause 39 amends section 43U (Concessionary rate of tax for shipping‑related\nsupport services) to extend till 31 December 2031 the last date on which a\ncompany may be approved for a tax incentive under the section. Clause 39 also\namends section 43U so that a company approved under that section may apply to\nthe Minister or authorised body for its special purpose vehicle to be approved for\nthe purpose of the section. An approved SPVof an approved company enjoys the\nsame concessionary rate of tax as the approved company in respect of certain\nincome derived by the approved SPV from the provision of any shipping‑related\nsupport services approved for the SPV. The approval of an SPV of an approved\ncompany expires on the same date on which the approval of the approved\ncompany expires.\n\nClause 39 also amends section 43U to include maritime technology service as a\nshipping‑related business and a shipping‑related support service, and the use of\nany ship for renewable energy activity as a shipping‑related business.

This\napplies to any proceedings that are heard before, on or after the date on which the\namendment to section 83 comes into force.\n\nClause 42 introduces a new section 92K to allow a company the ordinary\nshares of which are first listed or re‑listed on a stock exchange in Singapore by\nway of a primary listing or a secondary listing on a date on or after 19 February\n2025 (called the listing date), and which are offered in conjunction with the listing,\nto apply to the Minister or an authorised body to be approved for a tax rebate.\n\nSubsection (4) states that the application must be made within the time allowed\nby the Minister or authorised body and be accompanied by such information and\ndocuments as may be required. Subsection (5) provides that a financial sector\nincentive company approved for the purposes of the tax incentive in the new\nsection 43J(1B), and its holding company, are ineligible to apply for the approval\nof a tax rebate under section 92K.\n\nUnder subsections (6) and (7), the Minister or authorised body may approve a\ncompany for a single period of 5 years (called its incentive period), which starts\nfrom no earlier than 1 February 2025, and no approval may be given after\n31 December 2027 (subsection (9)).\n\nSubsection (8) provides that it is a condition of approval for the ordinary shares\nof an approved company to remain listed on a stock exchange in Singapore\nthroughout its incentive period, starting from its listing date.\n\nSubsections (10) to (12) provide for the determination of the tax rebate. A\nrebate of either 20% or 10% of the tax payable by the approved company is to be\nmade to it for each year of assessment relating to a basis period that falls within its\nincentive period. The higher rebate of 20% is to be made to an approved company\nfor the part of a basis period where its shares are listed by way of a primary listing\non a stock exchange in Singapore, and the lower rebate of 10% is to be made to it\nfor the part of a basis period where its shares are listed by way of a secondary\n\n\n-----\n\n124\n\nlisting on a stock exchange in Singapore. The rebate is subject to a cap of\n$6 million or $3 million based on the amount of the approved company’s market\ncapitalisation on the listing date.\n\nSubsection (13) provides for the determination of the rebate cap if, in the basis\nperiod for a year of assessment, the listing of the company’s ordinary shares\nconverts from a primary listing to a secondary listing, or vice versa. The rebate cap\nis then to be determined based on the number of months in the parts of the basis\nperiod for that year of assessment, before and after the listing conversion occurs.\n\nUnder subsection (15), a company applying to be approved under this section\nmay, at any time before its approval, nominate for the Minister’s or authorised\nbody’s approval up to 3 of its eligible subsidiaries (as defined in subsection (19))\nto which the tax rebate may be given in addition to the company. The company\nmust specify the order in which the rebate is to be made to the nominees.\nSubsection (16) provides that the company may, after its approval, nominate\nadditional eligible subsidiaries if less than 3 eligible subsidiaries are approved\nunder subsection (15)(a).\n\nSubsections (17) and (18) provide for the effective date of an approval of a\nnominee.\n\nSubsection (20) provides that the nomination of any approved nominee is\ntreated as revoked if the nominee is in liquidation, ceases to carry on a trade or\nbusiness in Singapore, or ceases to exist at any time during the basis period for a\nyear of assessment, and the nomination is treated as revoked on the first day of that\nbasis period in which the liquidation commences or the cessation falls.\n\nSubsection (21) provides that the nomination of any approved nominee is\ntreated as revoked if the nominee ceases to be wholly‑owned (directly or\nindirectly) by the approved company, or ceases to have a financial year that ends\non the same day as that of the approved company, at any time during the basis\nperiod for a year of assessment, and the nomination is treated as revoked on the\nfirst day of that basis period.\n\nSubsection (22) allows the approved company to apply to the Minister or\nauthorised body within a specified period for approval of another eligible\nsubsidiary as a replacement for a nominee whose revocation has been treated as\nrevoked under subsection (20) or (21).\n\nSubsection (23) provides that the approval of the replacement nominee takes\neffect from the date of the deemed revocation of the replaced nominee or the first\nday of the month in which the replacement nominee first becomes an eligible\nsubsidiary of the approved company, whichever is later. The Minister or\nauthorised body may also specify any other date on which the approval of the\nreplacement nominee takes effect.\n\n\n-----\n\n125\n\nSubsection (23) also provides that the replacement nominee takes the position\nof the replaced nominee in the order of priority for the making of the rebate.\n\nSubsection (24) provides that a financial sector incentive company approved\nfor the purposes of the tax incentive in section 43J(1B), and its holding company,\nare ineligible to be a nominee.\n\nSubsection (25) states that the application under subsection (15), (16) or (22)\nmust be accompanied by such information and documents as may be required by\nthe Minister or authorised body.\n\nSubsection (26) provides for the order of priority in the making of a rebate to an\napproved company and its nominees. Essentially, the rebate is first to be made\nagainst the tax of the approved company, and then against that of its nominees\naccording to the order of priority specified by the approved company. A nominee\nnominated before the company is approved ranks ahead of a nominee that is\nnominated after such approval. A replacement nominee takes the place of the\nnominee it replaces.\n\nSubsection (27) applies (with modification) section 105R for the revocation of\napproval of an approved company for non‑compliance with a condition of its\napproval.\n\nFinally, subsection (28) disapplies the new section 92K to a variable capital\ncompany.\n\nClause 43 inserts a new section 92L to introduce a 50% corporate tax rebate for\nthe year of assessment 2025, as announced in the Government’s 2025 Budget\nStatement.\n\nThe new section 92L(1) provides for a corporate tax rebate for the year of\nassessment 2025. The rebate is 50% of the tax payable (less any cash grant of\n$2,000 made under the new section) or $40,000 (less the cash grant), whichever is\nlower. Where 50% of the tax payable is less than the cash grant of $2,000 made to\nthe company, no corporate tax rebate will be given.\n\nThe new section 92L(3) and (6) provides for a non‑taxable cash grant of $2,000\nto be made to a company that has made a contribution to the Central Provident\nFund (CPF) in respect of at least one local employee (as defined in the new\nsection 92L(7)) in the calendar year 2024, in accordance with regulation 2(1) of\nthe Central Provident Fund Regulations (Rg 15). However, a company is not\nqualified for the cash grant if, at the time of its disbursement, it is not carrying on a\ntrade or business, it is in liquidation, it is in receivership in respect of all of its\nproperty, or it has ceased to exist.\n\nAccording to regulation 2(1) of the Central Provident Fund Regulations, all\ncontributions payable by an employer under section 7(1) of the Central Provident\nFund Act 1953 must be paid to the Central Provident Fund Board not later than\n14 days after the end of the month in respect of which the contributions are\n\n\n-----\n\n126\n\npayable. The new section 92L(5) enables the Comptroller to waive such\nrequirement in the case of a late CPF contribution if he or she is satisfied that\nit is just and equitable to do so.\n\nClause 44 inserts a new section 93AA as a result of the enactment of\nsection 13(1)(zpa) with effect from 1 January 2013. The new section 93AA\napplies with modification section 93 (Repayment of tax) to enable a person who\nhad paid tax on any payment received under the public scheme known as the\nWorkfare Training Support scheme (now known as the Workfare Skills Support\n(Basic) scheme) that is not payable because of the backdating of the enactment of\nsection 13(1)(zpa), to apply to the Comptroller for a refund. The application must\nbe made on or before 31 December 2029.\n\nClause 45 amends section 93B (Refundable investment credits) so that for the\npurposes of subsections (5)(i), (12)(h) and (23)(a), the date on which an awardee\ncompany makes an application to the approving authority for an amount of RICs\nto be given to it is included in determining the last date on which any unutilised\nRICs, or any amount of RICs which the awardee company has elected to be paid to\nit, must be paid to the company.\n\nNext, clause 45 amends section 93B to apply the existing recovery provisions\nunder subsections (38)(b), (40), (41) and (42) to an amendment of a letter of award\nunder subsections (13) and (14), as those recovery provisions apply to any\namendment of a letter of award.\n\nNext, clause 45 amends section 93B to allow the approving authority to amend\nany letter of confirmation in any prescribed circumstances, and for the recovery\nprovisions mentioned in the preceding paragraph to apply to an amendment of\nletter of confirmation.\n\nNext, clause 45 amends section 93B(23)(b) to enable regulations to be made to\nprovide for the revocation of an election by an awardee company for any amount\nof its RICs to be paid to it, and the circumstances under which the election is\ntreated as revoked.\n\nNext, clause 45 replaces section 93B(31) to make clear that any monetary\npayment is to be made under that provision only to the extent that the RICs have\nnot been revoked (or treated as revoked) or debited from the RIC account of the\nawardee company under section 93B(40)(a).\n\nNext, clause 45 amends section 93B to require an application under\nsubsection (43)(c) by an amalgamated company (Y) for RICs of one of the\ncompanies in the amalgamation (X) to be transferred to it, to be made within a\nprescribed period after the date of amalgamation. If the application is not made\nwithin the prescribed period or is refused, then the amount of RICs is forfeited: see\nthe new subsection (45A). Further, section 93B(45)(b) is amended to make it\nclearer and to provide that the unutilised RICs of X are treated as having been\ngiven to Y on the date they were first given to X, but without affecting any debit of\n\n\n-----\n\n127\n\nRICs from Y’s own RIC account carried out before those unutilised RICs are\ncredited to that account. This is to address any uncertainty as to the RICs that were\nactually used owing to the first‑in‑first‑out principle of debiting RICs under\nsubsection (28).\n\nNext, clause 45 inserts the new section 93B(45B) to provide that\nsection 93B(45) and the new section 93B(45A) override the effects of\namalgamation under section 215G(c) of the Companies Act 1967 (which\nprovides that upon an amalgamation, the property and rights, etc., of an\namalgamating company are transferred to and vested in the amalgamated\ncompany), and section 34C of the ITA (which, among other things, provides\nthat rights and obligations of an amalgamating company in a qualifying\namalgamation are those of the amalgamated company when the former ceases\nto exist on the date of amalgamation).\n\nNext, clause 45 amends section 93B(46) to enable the Minister to make\nregulations —\n\n(a) to provide that, where an awardee company (X) nominates another\ncompany (Y) in the same group for X’s RICs to be used to offset Y’s due\ntaxes, the provisions in section 93B apply in relation to Y as they apply\nin relation to X, but only if Y satisfies prescribed requirements;\n\n(b) to provide for the recovery from Y of any amount of X’s RICs that have\nbeen used to offset Y’s due tax in prescribed circumstances, and for\n_X’s RICs that were debited from X’s RIC account for such purpose to_\nbe credited back to that account; and\n\n(c) to provide that any amount of X’s RICs that were credited back to its\nRIC account under the prescribed circumstances mentioned in\nparagraph (b), or otherwise wrongly debited from X’s RIC account\nand credited back to the account, is treated as having been given to X\non the date that the RICs were first given to X. The regulations may\nfurther provide that this treatment does not affect any previous debit of\nRICs from X’s RIC account.\n\nFinally, clause 45 amends section 93B by inserting new subsections (48A) to\n(48D).\n\nThe new subsection (48A) provides that if —\n\n(a) any amount of RICs of an awardee company is erroneously used to\noffset the due tax of any company (including the awardee company); or\n\n\n-----\n\n128\n\n(b) a monetary payment equivalent to an amount of RICs of an awardee\ncompany is erroneously paid to it,\n\nthe amount so offset or paid is recoverable as a debt due to the Government.\n\nThe new subsection (48B) provides for the time and manner of repayment of\nthe amount due, and the recovery of such amount by the Comptroller.\n\nThe new subsection (48C) provides that the amount of RICs erroneously used\nto offset due tax, or in respect of which a monetary payment was erroneously\nmade, is to be credited back to the awardee company’s RIC account and treated as\nhaving been given to the awardee company on the date that the RICs were first\ngiven to the awardee company under subsection (17), in order to preserve the\npayout date or payment date of those RICs as determined by the section or the\nregulations. However, if the payout date or payment date has passed, the new\nsubsection (48D) empowers the Minister to prescribe a different payout date or\npayment date.\n\nClause 46 inserts a new section 93C to provide for the recovery by the\nComptroller of any cash grant given under Part 19 (other than a grant under\nsection 92B, 92C, 92J or 93B) that is made to a company that did not satisfy the\nrequirements to receive the cash grant, or that is in excess of what may be given to\nthe company. The cash grant or excess amount is treated as a debt due from the\ncompany to the Government.\n\nThe new section 93C(5) requires any amount of cash grant to be reduced by the\namount of the debt owed by the company to the Government.\n\nThe new section 93C(6) requires any amount of cash grant to be reduced to pay\nany income tax, goods and services tax, property tax or stamp duty (including any\ninterest or penalty) due from the company.\n\nClause 47 amends section 105I (Interpretation of this Part) to insert a new\ndefinition “crypto‑asset reporting framework agreement” or “CARF agreement”\nfor the purposes of the amended section 105K. A CARF agreement is a bilateral or\nmultilateral agreement based on the International Standards for Automatic\nExchange of Information in Tax Matters pursuant to the Crypto‑Asset Reporting\nFramework developed by the OECD.\n\nClause 48 amends section 105K (International tax compliance agreements) to\nenable the Minister to declare a CARF agreement as an international tax\ncompliance agreement for the purposes of Part 20B.\n\nClause 49 amends section 107 (Variable capital companies or VCCs) to make\namendments for the purpose of the application of the amended section 13W to a\nsub‑fund of a VCC and to disapply the new section 14EB to a VCC.\n\nNext, clause 49 amends section 107(11) to make a consequential amendment\narising from the enactment of new section 14MA.\n\n\n-----\n\n129\n\nFinally, clause 49 amends section 107(28A) to apply the new section 92L to a\nVCC by replacing the definitions of “employee” and “local employee” in\nsection 92L(7) with a new definition of “local employee”.\n\nClause 50 amends the Third Schedule to make amendments to section 13W (as\nit applies to a sub‑fund) arising from the amendments to section 13W by clause 10.\n\nClause 51 amends the Fourth Schedule (Prescribed sections) to include the new\nsection 14EB as a prescribed section for the purposes of section 105R (Revocation\nof approval).\n\nClause 52 amends sections 43E, 43I, 43N and 43X to make technical\ncorrections as to the reference to an authorised body when a function or power\nmentioned in any of the following provisions is exercised on or before 11 April\n2024:\n\n(a) section 43E(1A)(c) and (d) and (1B);\n\n(b) section 43I(1AA)(d) and (1AC);\n\n(c) section 43N(1)(c) and (d) and (1D);\n\n(d) section 43X(5)(b), (c) and (d), (6)(a) and (b) and (6A).\n\nThe reason for this amendment is that the functions and powers under\nsections 43E, 43I, 43N and 43X were only assigned to the Economic Development\nBoard or Enterprise Singapore Board (as the case may be) as an authorised body\nunder section 3A of the ITAwith effect from 12 April 2024. An authorised body in\nrespect of the provisions mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (d) did not exist until\n12 April 2024.\n\nClause 52 also amends section 43X(5)(a) to replace the reference to an\nauthorised body with a reference to a person appointed by the Minister for the\nsame reason above.\n\nClause 53 amends sections 13, 43H and 45A to allow for the backdating of\ncertain proposed amendments to the Income Tax (Qualifying Debt Securities)\nRegulations (Rg 35), the Income Tax (Qualifying Project Debt Securities)\nRegulations 2008 (G.N. No. S 315/2008), and the Income Tax (Concessionary\nRate of Tax or Exemption for Income Derived from Debt Securities) Regulations\n(Rg 32) to implement the changes announced in the Government’s 2023 Budget\nStatement or communicated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in respect of\nthe tax incentive schemes for qualifying debt securities and qualifying project debt\nsecurities.\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Income Tax (Qualifying Debt Securities)\nRegulations seek to prescribe the conditions for the exemption from tax under\nsection 13(1)(a), (aa), (ab) and (ba) of income derived from qualifying debt\nsecurities issued between 1 January 2024 and 31 December 2028. The proposed\namendments implement the amendments made to the ITA by section 7(a) of the\n\n\n-----\n\n130\n\nIncome Tax (Amendment) Act 2023 to extend the last date (from 31 December\n2023 to 31 December 2028) on which qualifying debt securities must be issued for\ncertain income derived by certain persons from those debt securities to be exempt\nfrom tax under those provisions. Under the new subsection (17A), amendments to\nthose Regulations for this purpose may be made to take effect from 1 January\n2024.\n\nNext, amendments are proposed to be made to the Income Tax (Qualifying\nDebt Securities) Regulations to implement the amendment to section 45A(2A) of\nthe ITA by section 41(a) of the Income Tax (Amendment) Act 2023, which\nextended the period (from 31 December 2023 to 31 December 2028) within which\nIslamic debt securities which are qualifying debt securities must be issued for the\nwithholding tax exemption under that section to apply to income derived from\nsuch securities. Under the new section 45A(2AA), amendments to those\nRegulations to impose conditions to apply the withholding tax exemption to\namounts payable from Islamic debt securities issued between 1 January 2024 and\n31 December 2028 may be made to take effect from 1 January 2024.\n\nNext, amendments are proposed to be made to the Income Tax (Qualifying\nDebt Securities) Regulations and Income Tax (Qualifying Project Debt Securities)\nRegulations 2008 to prescribe the arrangements that fall within the definitions of\n“qualifying debt securities” and “qualifying project debt securities” in\nsection 13(16) of the ITA, as amended by section 7(i), (j), (k), (l), (m) and (n),\nand section 7(p), (q), (r) and (s) of the Income Tax (Amendment) Act 2023. Under\nthe new section 13(17C), (17D) and (17E), regulations may be made for this\npurpose to take effect from 15 February 2023 or 1 January 2024, to give effect to\nthe changes announced in the Government’s 2023 Budget Statement or\ncommunicated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\nNext, amendments are proposed to be made to the Income Tax (Concessionary\nRate of Tax or Exemption for Income Derived from Debt Securities) Regulations\nto implement the amendments to section 43H of the ITA by section 36(a) of the\nIncome Tax (Amendment) Act 2023, which extended the periods in which\nqualifying debt securities must be issued, and income from trading in Singapore\nGovernment securities must be derived by a primary dealer, for the tax incentives\nunder section 43H to apply. Under the new section 43H(3AA), regulations to be\nmade in connection with these amendments may be made to take effect from\n1 January 2024, being the start date of the extended period.\n\nNext, amendments are proposed to be made to the Regulations mentioned\nabove to replace the terms “break cost” and “prepayment fee” with the term “early\nredemption fee”. The proposed amendments to those Regulations may be made to\ntake effect from 15 February 2023, the date on which the replacement of those\nterms in sections 13, 43H and 45A of the Act were deemed to have come into\nforce.\n\n\n-----\n\n131\n\nFinally, clause 53 makes it clear that section 45 (Withholding of tax in respect\nof interest paid to non‑resident persons) and section 45A (Application of\nsection 45 to royalties, management fees, etc.) do not apply to impose any\nwithholding tax obligation on a person in respect of any income payable by the\nperson which, but for the backdating of the proposed amendments to the Income\nTax (Qualifying Debt Securities) Regulations and the Income Tax (Qualifying\nProject Debt Securities) Regulations 2008 (made under sections 13(1) and\n45A(2A)), would not have been chargeable with tax.\n\nClause 54 amends the following sections:\n\n(a) section 13O (Exemption of income of company incorporated and\nresident in Singapore arising from funds managed by fund manager in\nSingapore);\n\n(b) section 13OA (Exemption of income of partners of limited partnership\narising from funds managed by fund manager in Singapore);\n\n(c) section 13U (Exemption of income arising from funds managed by\nfund manager in Singapore),\n\nto allow certain conditions for the exemption of tax, to take effect from 1 January\n2025. The conditions seek to implement changes announced in the\nGovernment’s 2024 Budget Statement in relation to tax incentive schemes for\nfunds managed in Singapore by fund managers and approved persons, and apply\nto prescribed income that is derived at any time between 1 January 2025 and the\ndate on which section 54 of the Finance (Income Taxes) Act 2025 comes into\nforce.\n\nClause 54 also amends section 13OA to enable the making of retrospective\nregulations (from 1 January 2025) for certain matters in relation to income of a\npartner of an approved limited partnership that is derived at any time between\n1 January 2025 and the date of commencement of that clause. This is also to give\neffect to the changes announced in the Government’s 2024 Budget Statement.\n\nClause 55 provides for a remission of the tax payable by a resident individual\nfor the year of assessment 2025. The amount of remission is 60% of the tax\npayable or $200, whichever is lower.\n\nPART 2\n\nAMENDMENT OF\nMULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE\n(MINIMUM TAX) ACT 2024\n\nPart 2 contains amendments to the MMTA.\n\nClause 56 amends the definition of “excluded equity gain or loss” in section 2\n(Interpretation) to include gains or losses from impairment of direct ownership\n\n\n-----\n\n132\n\ninterest in an entity, in accordance with Article 3.2.1(c) of the GloBE Model Rules\nread with its Commentary.\n\nNext, clause 56 amends the definition of “multi‑parent group” in section 2 so\nthat a combined group qualifies as a “multi‑parent group” so long as one entity or\npermanent establishment of the combined group (whether it is a constituent entity\nor an excluded entity) is located in a different jurisdiction from the others.\n\nNext, clause 56 amends the definition of “portfolio shareholding” in section 2\nin accordance with the definition of that term in the GloBE Model Rules, where\nthe test of the carrying of at least 10% of the aggregated rights is applied to all\nentities of the group, and not just its constituent entities.\n\nNext, clause 56 inserts new subsections (6A) to (6C) in section 2 to enable\nregulations prescribing a foreign tax as a qualified domestic minimum top‑up tax,\nqualified IIR or qualified UTPR, to provide for start and end dates for the tax to be\ntreated as such. The clause also inserts a new subsection (6D) to provide that the\nregulations may be made by reference to a webpage that is accessible from a\nprescribed Internet website of the OECD, as amended from time to time.\n\nNext, clause 56 inserts new subsections (6E) and (6F) in section 2 to define the\nterm “reference entity” in relation to a flow‑through entity of a group, for the\npurposes of the amended section 3 and paragraph 6 of the First Schedule. A\nreference entity is one that holds a direct ownership interest in the flow‑through\nentity (B) or holds an indirect ownership interest in B through one or more\nflow‑through entities. Where there is no such entity, then a flow‑through entity\nthat is the ultimate parent entity of the group is a reference entity in relation to B.\n\nFinally, clause 56 inserts new subsections (6G) and (6H) in section 2 to define\n“securitisation entity” which is an entity excluded under the amended sections 33\nand 34 (unless it is the only constituent entity located in Singapore) and the\namended section 59.\n\nClause 57 amends section 3 (“Flow‑through entity”, “reverse hybrid entity”\nand meaning of fiscal transparency) by inserting a new subsection (1A) to reflect\nArticle 10.2.4 of the GloBE Model Rules. Under that Article, a constituent entity\nthat is not a tax resident and not subject to a covered tax or a qualified domestic\nminimum top‑up tax based on its place of management, place of creation or\nsimilar criteria is treated as a flow‑through entity if certain conditions are satisfied.\n\nClause 57 also amends the definition of “reverse hybrid entity” in section 3(2)\nto reflect the guidance in Chapter 5 of the June 2024 AG, that whether or not a\nflow‑through entity is a reverse hybrid entity is to be determined by reference to\nthe tax law of the jurisdiction in which its reference entity (as defined in the\namended section 2) is located.\n\nFinally, clause 57 amends section 3(3) which defines when an entity is “fiscally\ntransparent”, so that an entity (X) is fiscally transparent under a law if that law\n\n\n-----\n\n133\n\ntreats X’s income, expenditure, profit or loss (or that of another entity in which X\nholds ownership interest) as though it is derived or incurred by X’s direct owner in\nproportion to the owner’s interest in X.\n\nClause 58 amends section 8 (MNE group to which the MMTA applies) to\nenable regulations to be made to modify any part of the threshold\n(EUR 750 million in consolidated group revenue for 2 out of the last\n4 financial years) for the MMTA to apply to an MNE group that results from a\ndemerger.\n\nClause 59 amends section 20 (GloBE Safe Harbours) to remove the condition\nthat an election to apply a GloBE Safe Harbour is only effective if made by the due\ndate for the filing of the GloBE information return for the financial year in\nquestion, as the election is not dependent on such due date. The amendment will\nalign this election with other elections under the Act.\n\nClause 60 amends section 22 (Top‑up amounts of stateless entities) by\nproviding that in determining the jurisdictional top‑up amount for a stateless entity\n(for the purpose of arriving at its top‑up amount), there is to be further deducted\nany amount of DTT imposed in respect of it if it is also a section 29(b) entity.\n\nClause 61 amends section 25 (Application of Part 2 to joint ventures and JV\nsubsidiaries) by removing unnecessary modifications made to various provisions\nincorporated by reference in section 25 for the purpose of determining the FANIL,\nGloBE income or loss, qualifying current tax expenses, qualifying deferred tax\nexpenses and adjusted covered taxes for a financial year of a standalone JVor an\nentity of a JV group.\n\nClause 62 amends section 26 (Multi‑parent groups) to allow regulations to be\nmade to prescribe how the other provisions of the MMTA (in addition to Part 2)\napply to a multi‑parent group.\n\nClause 63 makes a minor editorial amendment to section 27 (Purpose of\nPart 3).\n\nClause 64 amends section 30 (Top‑up amounts of constituent entities).\nSection 30 applies, with modifications, certain provisions of Part 2 (and by\nextension provisions of the First Schedule) to determine the top‑up amount of each\nconstituent entity of an MNE group, which is in turn necessary for determining the\nDTT payable by the MNE group. The amendment clarifies that where qualifying\ncurrent tax expenses and qualifying deferred tax expenses are not to be allocated to\na constituent entity because of any such modification, then such expenses must not\nbe allocated under the new sub‑paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 1(5) of the\nFirst Schedule.\n\nClause 64 also amends section 30 by amending subsection (4) (which applies\nsection 22 to determine the top‑up amount of a section 29(b) entity for determining\nDTT). The amendment is consequential to the amendment made to section 22.\n\n\n-----\n\n134\n\nClause 65 makes a minor editorial amendment to section 31 (Registration of\nMNE group).\n\nClause 66 amends section 33 (Designated local GIR filing entity) to exclude a\nsecuritisation entity (as defined in the amended section 2) from being designated\nas the designated local GIR filing entity of a registered MNE group, unless it is the\nonly constituent entity of the MNE group located in Singapore. The clause also\nmakes a minor editorial amendment to section 33.\n\nClause 67 amends section 34 (Designated local DTT filing entity) to exclude a\nsecuritisation entity (as defined in the amended section 2) from being designated\nas the designated local DTT filing entity of a registered MNE group, unless it is\nthe only constituent entity of the MNE group located in Singapore.\n\nClause 68 makes a minor editorial amendment to section 49 (Assessment).\n\nClause 69 amends section 59 (Recovery of unpaid DTT, interest and penalty) to\nprovide that a securitisation entity (as defined in the amended section 2) is not one\nthat is jointly and severally liable with other entities of an MNE group for DTTand\ninterest in respect of the MNE group that are in arrears.\n\nClause 70 inserts a new sub‑paragraph (aa) in sub‑paragraph (1) of paragraph 1\n(“Adjusted covered taxes” and “covered taxes”) of the First Schedule to give\neffect to Chapter 5 of the June 2024 AG. In determining the adjusted covered taxes\nof a constituent entity (A), account must be taken of any qualifying current tax\nexpense and qualifying deferred tax expense of another constituent entity that is\nallocated to a flow‑through entity in which A holds an ownership interest, and that\nis in turn allocated to A.\n\nNext, clause 70 amends paragraph 1(3)(d) of the First Schedule to clarify that\nthe reference in that provision to an indirect ownership held by an entity in a\nflow‑through entity is to an indirect ownership held through one or more other\nflow‑through entities only, and not any other type of entity. The same amendment\nis also made to the same reference wherever it occurs in paragraph 6.\n\nNext, clause 70 amends paragraph 1(4) of the First Schedule to clarify that the\nadjusted covered taxes of a main entity exclude the qualifying current tax expense\nand qualifying deferred tax expense in respect of its permanent establishment,\nwhether those expenses are reflected in the permanent establishment’s FANIL or\nelsewhere (e.g., in the main entity’s own FANIL).\n\nNext, clause 70 replaces sub‑paragraph (5) of paragraph 1 of the First Schedule\nand inserts new sub‑paragraphs (5A) to (5C) in that paragraph. The new\nparagraph 1(5)(b) to (d) and (5A) to (5C) gives effect to the guidance in Chapter 5\nof the June 2024 AG. Where a part of the FANIL of a flow‑through entity (A) is\nallocated to a constituent entity (B) with ownership interests in A, and (i) B;\n(ii) another constituent entity (C) that holds ownership interest in A through B; or\n(iii) another constituent entity (D) through which B holds ownership interest in A,\n\n\n-----\n\n135\n\nhad allocated any of its qualifying current tax expense and qualifying deferred tax\nexpense to A under the regulations, then a portion of that qualifying current tax\nexpense and qualifying deferred tax expense of B, C or D is to be allocated to B.\n\nNext, clause 70 amends paragraph 4 (Excluded entity) of the First Schedule to\nprovide that an investment fund or real estate investment vehicle need only be the\nultimate parent entity of a group (and not an MNE group) to qualify as an excluded\nentity. This is to reflect Article 1.5.1 of the GloBE rules.\n\nNext, clause 70 amends sub‑paragraph (6) of paragraph 6 (“GloBE income or\nloss” and “FANIL”) of the First Schedule, which provides for the FANIL of a\npermanent establishment. The provision is amended so that, for the purposes of\nthe definition of “FANIL” of a permanent establishment, the profits of a\npermanent establishment must be those reflected in separate financial accounts\nthat are prepared in accordance with an acceptable financial accounting standard\nor another financial accounting standard that is adjusted to prevent material\ncompetitive distortion.\n\nNext, clause 70 amends paragraph 6(9)(a)(ii) of the First Schedule to reflect\nChapter 5 of the June 2024 AG. The law of the jurisdiction in which the non‑group\nentity (B) mentioned in that provision is located need not treat each flow‑through\nentity through which B owns the flow‑through entity A, as fiscally transparent.\n\nNext, clause 70 replaces paragraph 6(9)(c) of the First Schedule to reflect\nChapter 5 of the June 2024 AG. The FANIL of a flow‑through entity (A) that is\nattributable to a reference entity of A (C) is to be allocated to C to the extent that\nthe law of the jurisdiction in which C is located treats A and each entity through\nwhich C owns A as fiscally transparent with respect to that FANIL.\nParagraph 6(11) (which is premised on the previous paragraph 6(9)(c)) is\nconsequently deleted.\n\nNext, clause 70 replaces paragraph 6(10) of the First Schedule to reflect\nChapter 5 of the June 2024 AG. Paragraph 6(9)(a) (exclusion of part of a\nflow‑through entity’s FANIL attributable to a non‑group owner) is disapplied to\nthe extent that ownership interests in the flow‑through entity are held by the\nultimate parent entity of the MNE group that is also a flow‑through entity, either\ndirectly or through one or more other flow‑through entities only.\n\nNext, clause 70 modifies the operation of paragraph 6(9) to (12) of the First\nSchedule by inserting a new sub‑paragraph (12A) and making consequential\namendments to sub‑paragraph (13). The new sub‑paragraph (12A) treats a\nflow‑through entity that would be the ultimate parent entity of an MNE group had\nany controlling interest held by an excluded entity in that entity been disregarded,\nas a flow‑through entity that is the ultimate parent entity of the MNE group.\nParagraph 6(9) to (13) sets out different ways in which the FANIL of a\nflow‑through entity is to be excluded or allocated, depending on whether it is the\nultimate parent entity of an MNE group.\n\n\n-----\n\n136\n\nFinally, clause 70 amends the definition of “real estate investment vehicle” in\nsub‑paragraph (3) of paragraph 7 (“Investment entity”, “investment fund”, “real\nestate investment vehicle” and “insurance investment entity”) of the First\nSchedule, so that an entity is also considered a real estate investment vehicle if\n(among other conditions) its income is subject to taxation in any jurisdiction as the\nincome of the holders of its indirect ownership interests (as defined in\nsection 2(6)).\n\nPART 3\n\nRELATED AMENDMENT TO\nGOODS AND SERVICES TAX ACT 1993\n\nClause 71 makes an amendment to section 56 of the Goods and Services Tax\nAct 1993 for the same purpose as the amendment to section 83 of the ITA by\nclause 41.\n\nPART 4\n\nSAVING AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISION\n\nClause 72 enables the Minister, for a period of 2 years after the publication in\nthe Gazette of the Finance (Income Taxes) Act 2025, to make saving and\ntransitional provisions by regulations.\n\n## EXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC MONEY\n\nThis Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact\namount of which cannot at present be ascertained.\n\n\n-----\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"bill_introduction": {"type": "string", "description": "A short description of what the bill is about in no more than 2-3 sentences.
