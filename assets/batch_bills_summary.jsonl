However, access, collection or disclosure of\naccessible health information is not considered to be required or\npermitted under any Act merely because the individual has consented\nor has given his or her consent in accordance with Part 4 of the PDPA,\nor such consent is not required under Part 4 of the PDPA.\n\nClause 31 provides for how an access restriction may be imposed or revoked.\n\nClause 32 provides that an access restriction may not be revoked under\nclause 31 in respect of accessible health information about a deceased individual,\nwhere the access restriction is in force immediately before the date of death of the\ndeceased individual.\n\nClause 33 sets out a transitional provision for administrative measures to\nprevent or restrict access to accessible health information about an individual\nimposed under the current governance framework for the national electronic\nrecords system, where the measures are in force immediately before the date of\ncommencement of clause 31. These administrative measures correspond to access\nrestrictions under the Bill.\n\nDivision 6 of Part 2 concerns the actions that may be taken against a\ncontributor, a user or an authorised individual of a user.\n\nClause 34 empowers an authorised officer to direct a System Operator to take\nany action described in clause 34(2) against a contributor or user or an authorised\nindividual of a user if any of the following applies:\n\n(a) the authorised officer is satisfied that the contributor, user or\nauthorised individual of a user is contravening or has contravened\nany requirement under Part 2, the contravention of which is not an\noffence;\n\n(b) the authorised officer —\n\n(i) has reason to believe that the contributor, user or authorised\nindividual of a user is contravening or has contravened any\nprovision of the Bill, the contravention of which is an offence;\nand\n\n(ii) is satisfied that it is necessary to take the action in order to\nprevent or minimise any harm or damage to the national\nelectronic records system pending the outcome of any\nproceedings against the contributor, user or authorised\n\n\n-----\n\n167\n\nindividual of a user for an offence arising from the\ncontravention;\n\n(c) the contributor, user or authorised individual of a user has been\nconvicted of an offence under the Bill;\n\n(d) the authorised officer is satisfied that the public interest so requires.\n\nClause 35 sets out the procedure that an authorised officer must comply with\nbefore giving a direction under clause 34.\n\nClause 36 provides that a contributor or user or an authorised individual of a\nuser aggrieved by an authorised officer’s decision to give a direction under\nclause 34 to take action against the contributor, user or authorised individual of a\nuser has a right of appeal to the Minister.\n\nClause 37 provides that the Minister may designate a Second Minister, any\nMinister of State or any Parliamentary Secretary to hear and determine any appeal\nor a specific appeal under clause 36 in the Minister’s place.\n\nDivision 7 of Part 2 sets out offences relating to accessible health information\nand derived information.\n\nClause 38 provides for offences relating to the improper access or collection of\naccessible health information. In particular, the clause provides for the following\nprohibitions:\n\n(a) a specified user or an authorised individual of a specified user must not\naccess or collect accessible health information about any individual\nexcept for a specified purpose mentioned in clause 19(2), or as\notherwise required or permitted under the Bill;\n\n(b) an approved user or an authorised individual of an approved user must\nnot —\n\n(i) access or collect any type of accessible health information that\nis not specified in the notification published in respect of that\napproved user under clause 20(2); or\n\n(ii) access or collect accessible health information about any\nindividual except for a purpose specified in that notification, or\nas otherwise required or permitted under the Bill; and\n\n(c) a user or an authorised individual of a user must not access or collect\naccessible health information about any individual in a manner that is\ncontrary to any access restriction imposed in respect of that accessible\nhealth information that is in force and where the access or collection is\nnot otherwise permitted under clause 30(3), (4) or (5).\n\nA person who contravenes clause 38 commits an offence. A person who\ncontravenes the clause by accessing or collecting accessible health information\n\n\n-----\n\n168\n\nabout any individual for an excluded purpose faces enhanced punishment upon\nconviction. The excluded purposes for the purposes of clause 38 are the same as\nthose that apply in relation to clause 19.\n\nClause 39 makes it an offence for a person who is not a user or an authorised\nindividual of a user to access or collect accessible health information about any\nindividual for any purpose, unless the access or collection is required or permitted\nunder the Bill or another written law, or by an order of court. Such access or\ncollection is not considered to be required or permitted under any written law\nmerely because the individual has consented or has given his or her consent in\naccordance with Part 4 of the PDPA, or such consent is not required under Part 4 of\nthe PDPA.\n\nClause 40 makes it an offence —\n\n(a) for a user or an authorised individual of a user to disclose accessible\nhealth information about any individual, or any document that\nreproduces (fully or substantially) accessible health information\nabout any individual, to any other person except in specified\ncircumstances; and\n\n(b) for a person who is not a user or an authorised individual of a user to\ndisclose accessible health information about any individual, or any\ndocument that reproduces (fully or substantially) accessible health\ninformation about any individual, unless the disclosure is required or\npermitted under the Bill or another written law, or by an order of court.\n\nFor the purposes of clause 40, disclosure of accessible health information about an\nindividual is not considered to be required or permitted under any written law\nmerely because the individual has consented or has given his or her consent in\naccordance with Part 4 of the PDPA, or such consent is not required under Part 4 of\nthe PDPA. The clause also sets out a defence for the accused to prove, on a balance\nof probabilities, that the accused did not know, and had no reason to believe, that\nthe accused had disclosed accessible health information or a document\nreproducing accessible health information.\n\nClause 41 makes it an offence for a requestor or an authorised individual of a\nrequestor to disclose or use derived information in contravention of clause 27. It is\nalso an offence for a requestor who obtains type 2 derived information, or an\nauthorised individual of any such requestor, to do any act or take any step to\nidentify or cause the identification of any individual from the type 2 derived\ninformation.\n\nClause 42 makes it an offence for any such person who is not a requestor —\n\n(a) to access, collect, disclose or use any information that the person\nknows or has reason to believe is derived information; or\n\n\n-----\n\n169\n\n(b) to do any act or take any step to identify or cause the identification of\nany individual from aggregated or anonymised health information,\nwhere the person knows or has reason to believe that the aggregated or\nanonymised health information in question is type 2 derived\ninformation.\n\nDivision 8 of Part 2 sets out miscellaneous provisions for the purposes of the\nPart.\n\nClause 43 applies to a person (X) who is not a user or an authorised individual\nof a user. The Minister may, by written notice, direct X to stop accessing or\ncollecting accessible health information about any individual and delete or destroy\nall copies of any such accessible health information that is in the possession or\nunder the control of X, if —\n\n(a) the Minister has reason to believe that X is contravening or has\ncontravened clause 39(1), and it is necessary for X to take any such\naction in order to prevent or minimise any harm or damage to any\nindividual pending the outcome of any proceedings against X for an\noffence arising from that contravention; or\n\n(b) X is convicted of an offence arising from a contravention of\nclause 39(1).\n\nThe Minister may also direct X to delete or destroy all copies of accessible\nhealth information about any individual that is in the possession or under the\ncontrol of X, if the Minister has reason to believe that X’s possession or control of\nthe accessible health information is not required or permitted under the Bill or\nanother written law, or by an order of court.\n\n_X commits an offence if X, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with the_\nMinister’s direction under clause 43. The possession or control of accessible\nhealth information about an individual is not considered to be required or\npermitted under any written law merely because the individual has consented or\nhas given his or her consent in accordance with Part 4 of the PDPA, or such\nconsent is not required under Part 4 of the PDPA.\n\nClause 44 sets out transitional provisions relating to existing contracts or\nagreements entered into between a person and the Government under the current\ngovernance framework for the national electronic records system, under which the\nperson —\n\n(a) contributes or agrees to contribute health information about any\nindividual to the national electronic records system; or\n\n(b) is allowed to access and collect health information about any\nindividual that is made available on the national electronic records\nsystem. The transitional provisions also allow the continued retention\n\n\n-----\n\n170\n\nand use of any such health information that was so accessed and\ncollected.\n\nPART 3\n\nSHARING OF RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR\nSPECIFIED USE CASES\n\nPart 3 (clauses 45 to 60) provides a statutory framework for the sharing of\nrelevant information about individuals in relation to specified use cases.\n\nClause 45 sets out definitions for the purposes of Part 3, including the key\ndefinitions of “data request”, “data sharing agreement”, “discloser” and\n“recipient”.\n\nClause 46 sets out the definition of “relevant information” for the purposes of\nPart 3.\n\nClause 47 sets out the definition of “use case” for the purposes of Part 3.\n\nClause 48 provides that —\n\n(a) Part 3 does not apply to the disclosure, collection and use of accessible\nhealth information about any individual;\n\n(b) Part 3 does not prevent or restrict the disclosure, collection or use of\nrelevant information about any individual in accordance with any other\nprovision of the Bill or any other written law or rule of law or by an\norder of court;\n\n(c) a person is not to be taken to be a discloser or recipient on the basis that\nthe person is a contributor, user or requestor under the Bill; and\n\n(d) nothing in Part 3 imposes an obligation on a discloser to collect any\nrelevant information for the purpose of enabling the discloser to\ndisclose that information to any recipient under this Part.\n\nClause 49 provides that a discloser or recipient who does anything under Part 3\nthrough a health data intermediary has the same obligations under the Part as one\nwho acted directly.\n\nClause 50 provides that despite any other written law or rule of law or any\nobligation of confidentiality imposed by contract, the consent of an individual (P)\nis not required for —\n\n(a) the disclosure by a discloser of relevant information about P to a\nrecipient;\n\n(b) the recipient’s collection of relevant information about P disclosed by\nthe discloser; and\n\n\n-----\n\n171\n\n(c) the recipient’s use of such relevant information,\n\nwhere the disclosure, collection or use is in accordance with Part 3.\n\nClause 51 sets out, in relation to a use case —\n\n(a) when a discloser may disclose relevant information about an\nindividual to a recipient; and\n\n(b) when the recipient may collect the relevant information from the\ndiscloser, and use that relevant information.\n\nClause 52 provides that a person or public agency who intends to disclose, and\na person or public agency who intends to collect and use, relevant information\nabout any individual in relation to a use case must enter into an agreement (data\nsharing agreement) that satisfies the requirements set out in the clause. These\npersons or public agencies must enter into the data sharing agreement before the\ndiscloser discloses any relevant information to the recipient. The type or types of\nrelevant information about any individual that may be disclosed, collected and\nused must be specified in the data sharing agreement. They must be no more than\nthe minimum necessary to implement or facilitate the use case in question. An\nagreement that does not satisfy the requirements in this clause is not considered a\ndata sharing agreement for the purposes of Part 3.\n\nClause 53 sets out a discloser’s obligations. The discloser may, in relation to a\nuse case, disclose relevant information about an individual to a recipient only if —\n\n(a) the recipient makes a data request to the discloser pursuant to a data\nsharing agreement that relates to that use case;\n\n(b) the purpose for which the recipient makes the data request comes\nwithin the scope of that use case; and\n\n(c) at the time the discloser discloses the relevant information to the\nrecipient in response to the recipient’s data request, the data sharing\nagreement in question is in force.\n\nFurther, the discloser must —\n\n(a) ensure, before disclosing the relevant information to the recipient, that\nevery type of relevant information to be disclosed is a type that is\nspecified in the data sharing agreement;\n\n(b) ensure that the relevant information —\n\n(i) is disclosed only by a personnel of the discloser, or of a health\ndata intermediary of the discloser, who is specified in the data\nsharing agreement; and\n\n\n-----\n\n172\n\n(ii) is disclosed only to a personnel of the recipient, or of a health\ndata intermediary of the recipient, who is specified in the data\nsharing agreement;\n\n(c) make reasonable efforts to ensure that the relevant information that is\ndisclosed —\n\n(i) is no more than the minimum that is necessary to implement or\nfacilitate the use case in question; and\n\n(ii) is accurate and complete; and\n\n(d) make reasonable efforts to ensure that the relevant information is\ndisclosed in a manner consistent with the data sharing agreement.\n\nClause 54 sets out a recipient’s obligations. The recipient must not, in relation\nto a use case, make a data request to a discloser for the disclosure of relevant\ninformation about any individual unless —\n\n(a) the data request is pursuant to a data sharing agreement between the\nrecipient and the discloser;\n\n(b) the purpose for which the recipient makes the data request comes\nwithin the scope of the use case in question; and\n\n(c) the recipient, having regard to all the circumstances of the case,\ngenuinely requires the relevant information for the purpose for which\nthe data request is made.\n\nIn relation to a data request, the recipient may disclose to the discloser any\ninformation about any individual to whom the data request relates if the disclosure\nof that information is necessary to identify the individual concerned, or to\nsubstantiate, or explain or elaborate on the purpose or scope of, the data request.\nHowever, the information that the recipient discloses must be no more than the\nminimum that is relevant to, and is necessary for, either of those purposes.\n\nClause 55 provides that a recipient that collects, in relation to a use case,\nrelevant information about any individual that is disclosed by a discloser pursuant\nto a data sharing agreement must ensure that the relevant information is collected\nonly by a personnel of the recipient, or of a health data intermediary of the\nrecipient, who is specified in the data sharing agreement between the recipient and\nthe discloser. The recipient must also make reasonable efforts to ensure that the\nrelevant information is collected in a manner consistent with the data sharing\nagreement.\n\nUnder clause 56 —\n\n(a) a recipient, a health data intermediary of a recipient or any personnel of\nthe recipient or the recipient’s health data intermediary must not use\nrelevant information about any individual collected from a discloser\n\n\n-----\n\n173\n\npursuant to a data sharing agreement, except to implement or facilitate\na use case specified in that data sharing agreement;\n\n(b) a health data intermediary of a recipient or any personnel of any such\nhealth data intermediary may process relevant information about any\nindividual for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the recipient’s use\nof that relevant information; and\n\n(c) the recipient must ensure that relevant information about any\nindividual is made available to any personnel of the recipient or the\nrecipient’s health data intermediary only to the extent that is necessary\nto enable the personnel or health data intermediary to carry out any\nfunction or perform any duty relating to the implementation or\nfacilitation of the use case in question.\n\nClause 57 provides that a recipient who collects, in relation to a use case,\nrelevant information about any individual that is disclosed by a discloser pursuant\nto a data sharing agreement must not disclose that relevant information to any\nother person, unless —\n\n(a) the disclosure is required or permitted by or under the Bill or another\nwritten law, or by an order of court; or\n\n(b) the relevant information is disclosed to any person and in any\ncircumstances that may be prescribed.\n\nThe disclosure of relevant information about an individual is not considered to be\nrequired or permitted under any written law merely because the individual has\nconsented or has given his or her consent in accordance with Part 4 of the PDPA,\nor such consent is not required under Part 4 of the PDPA.\n\nClause 58 provides that the Minister may, by regulations, require —\n\n(a) a discloser to provide a copy of any data sharing agreement between\nthe discloser and any recipient, or any document or information about\nany such data sharing agreement that may be prescribed; or\n\n(b) a recipient to provide a copy of any data sharing agreement between\nthe recipient and any discloser, or any document or information about\nany such data sharing agreement that may be prescribed.\n\nThe discloser or recipient must provide the copy of the data sharing agreement, or\ndocument or information, within the prescribed time and in the form or manner\nprescribed, if any. Non‑compliance with any such requirement is an offence.\n\nClause 59 empowers the Minister to issue directions to a discloser or recipient\nif the Minister has reason to believe that —\n\n(a) relevant information about any individual has been disclosed or\npurportedly disclosed by a discloser, or collected or used or\n\n\n-----\n\n174\n\npurportedly collected or used by a recipient, pursuant to a data sharing\nagreement between the discloser and recipient; and\n\n(b) the disclosure, collection or use of that relevant information is not in\naccordance with that data sharing agreement or the provisions of\nPart 3.\n\nThe Minister’s direction may require the discloser or recipient to take any one\nor more of the following actions:\n\n(a) review and assess whether the disclosure or purported disclosure, or\nthe collection or use or purported collection or use, of the relevant\ninformation is in accordance with the data sharing agreement between\nthe discloser and recipient and the provisions of Part 3;\n\n(b) identify any error, failure, inadequacy or shortcoming relating to the\ndisclosure or purported disclosure, or collection or use or purported\ncollection or use, of the relevant information, and take reasonable steps\nto remedy and prevent the recurrence of the error, failure, inadequacy\nor shortcoming;\n\n(c) provide to the Minister any document or information that the Minister\nmay reasonably require relating to any of those matters;\n\n(d) take any other action in relation to any of those matters that the\nMinister may reasonably require.\n\nThe Minister may additionally direct a recipient to take all reasonable steps to\nassist a discloser where the Minister is of the opinion that the recipient’s assistance\nis required or desirable to enable the discloser to properly and effectively carry out\nany action mentioned in clause 59(2)(a)(i) or (ii) that the Minister directs the\ndiscloser to take. Similarly, the Minister may direct a discloser to take all\nreasonable steps to assist a recipient where the Minister is of the opinion that the\ndiscloser’s assistance is required or desirable to enable the recipient to properly\nand effectively carry out any action that the Minister directs the recipient to take.\n\nFurther, under clause 59, the Minister may direct a discloser to stop disclosing\nrelevant information about any individual to any recipient, or take any other\nspecified action which the Minister reasonably considers to be necessary to bring a\ncontravention to an end and prevents its recurrence, if —\n\n(a) the Minister has reason to believe that the discloser has contravened\nclause 52(2) or 53(1), (2) or (3), or any condition or restriction imposed\nunder clause 53(4), and it is necessary for the discloser to take any such\naction in order to prevent or minimise any harm or damage to any\nindividual pending the outcome of any proceedings against the\ndiscloser for an offence arising from that contravention; or\n\n(b) the discloser is convicted of an offence under clause 60(1).\n\n\n-----\n\n175\n\nSimilarly, if —\n\n(a) the Minister has reason to believe that the recipient has contravened\nclause 52(2), 54(1) or (3), 55(1), 56(2) or (4) or 57(1), or any condition\nor restriction imposed under clause 54(5) or 56(5), and it is necessary\nfor the recipient to take a certain action in order to prevent or minimise\nany harm or damage to any individual pending the outcome of any\nproceedings against the recipient for an offence arising from that\ncontravention; or\n\n(b) the recipient is convicted of an offence under clause 60(2),\n\nthe Minister may direct a recipient —\n\n(c) to stop collecting relevant information about any individual collected\nfrom any discloser, or stop using relevant information about any\nindividual collected from any discloser that is in the possession or\nunder the control of the recipient;\n\n(d) to delete or destroy relevant information about any individual collected\nfrom any discloser;\n\n(e) to take all reasonable steps —\n\n(i) to retrieve all copies of relevant information about any\nindividual from any person to whom the recipient has\ndisclosed the relevant information; and\n\n(ii) to delete or destroy all copies of the relevant information that\nare retrieved; or\n\n(f) to take any other specified action which the Minister reasonably\nconsiders to be necessary to bring the contravention to an end and\nprevents its recurrence.\n\nA person who, without reasonable excuse, refuses or fails to comply with the\nMinister’s direction under clause 59 commits an offence.\n\nUnder clause 60, it is an offence for —\n\n(a) any person, without reasonable excuse, to contravene clause 52(2) or\n53(1), (2) or (3), or any condition or restriction imposed under\nclause 53(4); or\n\n(b) any person, without reasonable excuse, to contravene clause 52(2),\n54(1) or (3), 55(1), 56(2) or (4) or 57(1), or any condition or restriction\nimposed under clause 54(5) or 56(5).\n\n\n-----\n\n176\n\nPART 4\n\nSECURITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION AND\nRELEVANT INFORMATION\n\nPart 4 (clauses 61 to 71) provides for data security and cybersecurity\nobligations to ensure the security of health information and relevant information.\n\nDivision 1 of Part 4 sets out provisions of general application for the purposes\nof Part 4.\n\nClause 61 sets out definitions for the purposes of Part 4, including the key\ndefinition of “cybersecurity incident”.\n\nClause 62 defines “data breach” for the purposes of Part 4.\n\nClause 63 defines “relevant computer or computer system” for the purposes of\nPart 4.\n\nClause 64 provides that except as otherwise provided, Part 4 applies to a\ncontributor, user, requestor, System Operator, discloser or recipient under the Bill\n(relevant person). Further, Part 4 applies equally to and in relation to health\ninformation processed by a relevant HDI on behalf of and for the purposes of a\ncontributor or user and health information processed by a contributor or user\ndirectly.\n\nUnder clause 65, a relevant person must designate one or more individuals to\nbe responsible for ensuring that the relevant person complies with Parts 4 and 5.\nThe designation of any such individual does not relieve the relevant person of the\nrelevant person’s obligations under those Parts.\n\nDivision 2 of Part 4 sets out data security requirements in respect of health\ninformation and relevant information.\n\nClause 66 provides that a relevant person must —\n\n(a) implement reasonable controls to ensure the secure processing of\nhealth information or relevant information;\n\n(b) implement reasonable safeguards to protect against the unauthorised\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal,\ndestruction or loss of health information or relevant information; and\n\n(c) ensure that every personnel who accesses or handles health\ninformation or relevant information is aware of his or her role and\nresponsibility in ensuring that —\n\n(i) the confidentiality and integrity of the information is protected;\nand\n\n(ii) the information is available for use by the relevant person\n(including individuals employed or engaged by the relevant\n\n\n-----\n\n177\n\nperson who are authorised to access or handle that information)\nin the ordinary course of the relevant person’s activities.\n\nA relevant person who contravenes any of these requirements commits an offence.\n\nClause 66 also sets out —\n\n(a) a relevant person’s obligations in relation to health information or\nrelevant information that is in the form of or part of an extract or a\ncompilation of de-identified or aggregated information; and\n\n(b) where health information is processed by a relevant HDI of a\ncontributor or user, the obligations of the relevant HDI and the\ncontributor or user.\n\nA person who contravenes any such obligation commits an offence.\n\nClause 67 provides that a relevant person —\n\n(a) must cease to retain any health information or relevant information, or\nremove the means by which the information can be associated with any\nparticular individual, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that the\npurpose for which that information was collected is no longer being\nserved by its retention, and retention of that information is no longer\nnecessary for legal or business purposes; and\n\n(b) must take reasonable care, in relation to the disposal or destruction of\nany health information or relevant information, to prevent its\nunauthorised access, disclosure or reproduction.\n\nSimilar obligations apply to a relevant HDI of a contributor or user in respect of\nhealth information collected or processed on behalf of and for the purposes of the\ncontributor or user.\n\nA person who contravenes any obligation under clause 67 commits an offence.\n\nDivision 3 of Part 4 sets out cybersecurity requirements in relation to any\nrelevant computer or computer system used by a relevant person to process health\ninformation or relevant information.\n\nClause 68 provides that the relevant person must implement reasonable\nsafeguards, in relation to any such relevant computer or computer system —\n\n(a) to protect the confidentiality and integrity of health information or\nrelevant information;\n\n(b) to ensure the availability of the health information or relevant\ninformation for use in the ordinary course of the relevant person’s\nactivities; and\n\n(c) to protect the relevant computer or computer system against\nunauthorised access, interference or tampering.\n\n\n-----\n\n178\n\nIf health information is processed by a relevant HDI of a contributor or user,\nthe relevant HDI must similarly implement reasonable safeguards and comply\nwith any requirements prescribed in respect of those safeguards.

The new Part 6\n(sections 24 to 33) contains a more detailed set of financial provisions for the\nCouncil.\n\nThe new section 24 prescribes the financial year of the Council.\n\nThe new section 25 specifies the types of moneys and property that are included\nas the funds and property of the Council.

The definition is used in the new sections 4(5)(d) and\n(6)(a) and (d) (inserted by clause 3) and 6(1)(d) of the Act (inserted by clause 5).\nThe existing definition of “anonymised information” in section 8(4) of the Act is\ndeleted by clause 7(b).\n\n\n-----\n\n13\n\nThe definition of “data sharing direction” is replaced with a definition of “data\nsharing and use direction”. The term has the meaning given by new section 4(5) of\nthe Act (inserted by clause 3), that is, it refers to a direction under section 4(1) of\nthe Act relating to the sharing and use of information under the control of a\nSingapore public sector agency.\n\nNew definitions of “further authorisation” and “non‑public sector person” are\ninserted. These definitions refer to the meanings given by new section 4(5)(b) of\nthe Act (inserted by clause 3). A “non‑public sector person” is any person that is\nnot a Singapore public sector agency. The term “further authorisation” is further\nexplained in the explanation relating to clause 3.\n\nThe definition of “share”, in relation to information, is amended to exclude the\nact of being provided with information.\n\nClause 3 amends section 4 of the Act.\n\nClause 3(a) and (b) amends the pertinent subject matter mentioned in\nsection 4(3)(e) of the Act to include the use of information under the control of\na Singapore public sector agency, and to refer to the sharing of such information\ngenerally (instead of sharing with another Singapore public sector agency).\n\nClause 3(c) inserts new subsections (5) to (8) in section 4 of the Act. New\nsubsection (5) provides that a data sharing and use direction may authorise a\nSingapore public sector agency to share information under its control with another\nSingapore public sector agency or with any non‑public sector person, to use\ninformation under its control, or to re‑identify anonymised information under its\ncontrol.\n\nIn particular, under new subsection (5)(b), a data sharing and use direction may\nauthorise a Singapore public sector agency to share information under its control\nwith a non‑public sector person with the further authorisation of a Minister.\n\nNew subsection (6) provides that a data sharing and use direction must\nspecify —\n\n(a) the purposes for which the Singapore public sector agency may share\nor use information, or re‑identify anonymised information (as the case\nmay be);\n\n(b) the information that the Singapore public sector agency may share or\nuse (if applicable);\n\n(c) the other Singapore public sector agencies or non‑public sector\npersons with whom the Singapore public sector agency may share\ninformation (if applicable); and\n\n(d) the anonymised information that the Singapore public sector agency\nmay re‑identify (if applicable).\n\n\n-----\n\n14\n\nThese matters may be described generally (for example, by describing classes\nof information or non‑public sector persons) or specifically (for example, by\nnaming a particular non‑public sector person).\n\nUnder new subsection (7), a data sharing and use direction may (but need not)\nspecify the specific Minister or Ministers who may give a further authorisation\npursuant to that direction. If it does not so specify, any Minister may give a further\nauthorisation pursuant to that direction.\n\nWith a further authorisation, the Singapore public sector agency (to whom the\ndata sharing and use direction and further authorisation are given) is authorised to\nshare information with a non‑public sector person to the extent permitted by the\ndirection and further authorisation (under new section 6(1)(b) of the Act inserted\nby clause 5).\n\nUnder new subsection (8), a further authorisation must specify certain matters.\nThese are —\n\n(a) the specific purposes for which the Singapore public sector agency\nmay share information with a non‑public sector person;\n\n(b) the specific information that the Singapore public sector agency may\nshare with a non‑public sector person; and\n\n(c) the specific non‑public sector persons with whom the Singapore public\nsector agency may share information.\n\nThe scope of the specific purposes, information and non‑public sector persons\nmust be within the scope of the corresponding purposes, information and\nnon‑public sector persons specified in the data sharing and use direction to which\nthe further authorisation relates (as specified in accordance with new\nsubsection (6)).\n\nClause 4 makes a consequential amendment to the Division heading to\nDivision 2 of Part 2 of the Act.\n\nClause 5 replaces section 6 of the Act.\n\nNew section 6 of the Act relates to the authority conferred by data sharing and\nuse directions to share, use and re‑identify information, and is adapted from\nexisting section 6 of the Act. The changes from existing section 6 of the Act are —\n\n(a) to authorise Singapore public sector agencies and their officers and\nmembers to share information with non‑public sector persons, to the\nextent permitted by data sharing and use directions and their related\nfurther authorisations;\n\n(b) to authorise Singapore public sector agencies and their officers and\nmembers to use information, to the extent permitted by data sharing\nand use directions;\n\n\n-----\n\n15\n\n(c) to authorise Singapore public sector agencies and their officers and\nmembers to re‑identify anonymised information, to the extent\npermitted by data sharing and use directions;\n\n(d) to provide that Singapore public sector agencies (other than the agency\nto which the data sharing and use direction is given) may be provided\nwith information under the control of the agency to which the data\nsharing and use direction is given; and\n\n(e) to use the term “legal professional privilege” instead of “legal\nprivilege”, with no intended change in meaning.\n\nUnder new section 6(1)(b) of the Act, if a data sharing and use direction\nauthorises a Singapore public sector agency to share information with a\nnon‑public sector person, the Singapore public sector agency may only share\ninformation with a non‑public sector person if it has received the further\nauthorisation of a Minister to do so, and only to the extent permitted by the data\nsharing and use direction and the further authorisation.\n\nClause 6 amends section 7 of the Act. Clause 6(c) and (g) inserts new\nsubsections (1A) and (4A), respectively, which provide for offences by employees\nor officers of non‑public sector persons with whom information (other than\npersonal data) has been shared in accordance with a data sharing and use direction.\n\nUnder new subsection (1A), it is an offence for such an individual to disclose\nthe information, if the disclosure is not authorised by the data sharing and use\ndirection or a further authorisation given pursuant to the direction, and the\nindividual knows that the disclosure is not authorised or is reckless as to whether\nthe disclosure is authorised.\n\nUnder new subsection (4A), it is an offence for such an individual to use the\ninformation and, as a result, obtain a gain for himself or herself or for another\nperson, cause harm to another individual, or cause a loss to another person, if the\nuse is not authorised by the data sharing and use direction or a further\nauthorisation given pursuant to the direction, and the individual knows that the\nuse is not authorised or is reckless as to whether the use is authorised.\n\nClause 6(a) and (b) amends section 7 of the Act to include references to further\nauthorisations. Clause 6(d), (e), (f), (h) and (i) makes other consequential\namendments. Clause 6(j) inserts definitions related to new subsections (1A) and\n(4A).\n\nClause 7(a) amends section 8(1) of the Act to include references to further\nauthorisations.\n\nClause 8 makes related amendments to the PDPA. Clause 8(b) inserts a new\nsubsection (3) in section 48C of the PDPA to provide for the treatment of certain\nfactual scenarios where a public agency (as referred to in Part 9B of the PDPA)\nthat is also a Singapore public sector agency (as defined in the Act) shares\n\n\n-----\n\n16\n\npersonal data (as defined in the PDPA) in its possession or control in accordance\nwith a data sharing and use direction under the Act.\n\nSuch a public agency does not cease to have possession or control of the\npersonal data (for the purposes of Part 9B of the PDPA) merely by reason that it\nshared the personal data. For the purposes of the offences under sections 48D(1),\n48E(1) and 48F(1) of the PDPA, the acts of disclosure, use or re‑identification in\nthose offences are treated as not authorised by both the public agency and the\nreceiving entity, if they are not authorised by the data sharing and use direction or\nany further authorisation in respect of that direction.\n\nBy way of illustration, consider a public agency (A) (as defined in the PDPA)\nthat is also a Singapore public sector agency under the Act. A data sharing and use\ndirection is given to A under the Act, authorising A to share personal data under its\ncontrol with non‑public sector persons generally. A further authorisation pursuant\nto the data sharing and use direction is given to A, authorising A to share personal\ndata under its control with company B, a non‑public sector person, but only on the\ncondition that B and B’s employees do not disclose the personal data to any other\nperson. A shares personal data under its control with B. By the application of new\nsection 48C(3)(a) of the PDPA, A does not, by doing so, cease to have control over\nthe personal data.\n\n_B’s chief executive officer (C) then discloses the personal data to B’s holding_\ncompany. The disclosure is not authorised by the further authorisation. By the\napplication of new section 48C(3)(b) of the PDPA, the disclosure is, for the\npurposes of section 48D(1)(b) and (c) of the PDPA, not authorised by A or by B.\n\nIn this illustration, if C knows that the disclosure is not so authorised, C is guilty\nof an offence under section 48D(1) of the PDPA, because C disclosed personal\ndata under the control of A and B to another person, the disclosure was not\nauthorised by A or by B, and C disclosed the personal data knowing that the\ndisclosure was not authorised by A or by B.\n\nClauses 9 to 12 make consequential amendments to the Copyright Act 2021, the\nFood Safety and Security Act 2025, the Moneylenders Act 2008 and the Online\nSafety (Relief and Accountability) Act 2025 arising from the change of the term\n“data sharing direction” to “data sharing and use direction”.\n\nClause 13 empowers the Minister charged with the responsibility for public\nsector data governance to make regulations to prescribe any provision of a saving\nor transitional nature consequent on the enactment of any provision of the Bill for\na period of 2 years after the date of commencement of the provision.\n\n\n-----\n\n17\n\n## EXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC MONEY\n\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.\n\n\n-----\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"bill_introduction": {"type": "string", "description": "A short description of what the bill is about in no more than 2-3 sentences.
