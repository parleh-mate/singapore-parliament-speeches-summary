This Bill, together with the Workplace Fairness Act passed on 8 January 2025, represents a significant step forward in protecting Singapore's workers. However, I wish to raise several important questions and concerns regarding the implementation of this dispute resolution framework. Firstly, on the matter of representation at mediation. Section 36(i) provides that individuals may be represented by persons prescribed under the regulations made under section 44. I seek clarification on whether these regulations will mirror the First Schedule of the Employment Claims Regulations 2017. Under the current framework, trade union members face restrictions. They cannot be represented during settlement discussions and executive employees have even narrower representation rights. While I understand the intent to facilitate direct communication during mediation, we must ask  are these restrictions appropriate for discrimination cases which often involve complex power dynamics and emotional distress? Moreover, I am even more concerned about vulnerable workers who are not trade union members. What support will be available to them? Will pro bono channels be expanded to ensure all parties can access legal advice about their rights under the WFA? Additionally, the current regulations only mandate parental representation for those below 18 years of age. I urge the Ministry to consider extending support to young workers who have just entered the workforce. Fresh graduates who may be experiencing discrimination but lack the knowledge, resources or union membership to navigate the system effectively, particularly those with less than five years of full-time permanent employment. My second point concerns the discretion to extend the time limits under section 36E(4). The Bill stipulates that dismissed employees must file for mediation within one month of their last day of employment with special provisions for pregnant employees. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have encountered residents during my meet-the-people sessions (MPS) who, having just lost their jobs, were overwhelmed by distress, mental health challenges and/or the urgent need to support their families. In such circumstances, one month passes quickly, and by the time they seek help, the deadline has expired. Section 36F(1A) allows the Commissioner to accept late request if there is a reasonable excuse. However, this term requires greater clarity. I ask the Minister what constitutes a reasonable excuse. Will the Commissioner adopt the broader, just and equitable approach found in the United Kingdom's (UK's) Equality Act 2010, which the Employment Appeals Tribunal has interpreted as requiring a wide discretion based on the factual matrix. According to a Parliamentary reply by Senior Minister of State Dr Koh Poh Koon in 2022, approximately 6% of wrongful dismissal claims filed with TADM each year exceeded the time limit. TADM still assisted parties willing to set settle amicably. I would like to know  is this proportion still accurate? How many of such cases actually achieved settlement, and critically in 2024 and 2025, how many appeals for time extensions were filed and how many were granted? These statistics will help us understand whether the current framework adequately serves workers who may need additional time due to genuine hardship. My third point addresses the implementation of grievance handling processes. Section 36D(2) requires that mediation requests follow internal grievance handling, which section 27 of the WFA mandates employers to establish. While tripartite standards and implementation guides exist, I ask how many TADM claims involve employers who lacked proper grievance handling processes. This data is essential to access compliance and effectiveness. More importantly, have HR professionals in affected companies receive adequate training on these processes? What support has the Ministry provided for SMEs which may lack dedicated HR teams? Implementation presents particular challenges. I urge the Ministry to work closely with SMEs to boost their HR capabilities. Does the Ministry have a roadmap, perhaps over five years to help companies with fewer than 25 employees implement robust grievance handling processes? Without such support, the dispute resolution framework risks being undermined at its very foundation. Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I must address a significant gap in this Bill – the exclusion of outsourced workers. Section 36A limits civil action to alleged discriminatory employment decisions made by employers under section 17(1) of the WFA. An employer is defined as a person who employs another under a contract of service. This excludes workers on contracts for service, platform workers and critically outsourced workers. Outsourced workers are among our most vulnerable, often older workers in lower income jobs. Currently, the Tripartite Advisory on Outsourced Workers does not cover anti discriminatory practices by service buyers. This creates a troubling situation where service buyers can specify preferred race, age or religion of the workers, forcing service providers to implement discriminatory practices or face contractual penalties. It is unjust to penalise service providers when service buyers are the ones making discriminatory demands. We are, as the saying goes, barking up the wrong tree. The UK's Equality Act 2010 addresses this through section 41, which defines contract workers and principals. A principal is one who makes work available for individuals employed by another party and contract workers are those supplied in furtherance of such contracts. This framework effectively extends protection to outsourced workers. May I ask the Minister, will the Tripartite Advisory on Outsourced Workers be updated to cover anti-discriminatory practices by service buyers? Does the Ministry plan to extend WFA protection to outsourced workers in future amendments? And if so, what is the timeline? How is the Ministry currently educating service buyers on fair employment practices and monitoring discriminatory clauses in service contracts? Mr Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please. (In Malay)  Mr Deputy Speaker, the Workplace Fairness (Dispute Resolution) Bill aims to help individuals who face discrimination in the workplace. This Bill, together with the Workplace Fairness Act, represents an important step in protecting workers in Singapore. However, I would like to raise several questions and concerns regarding its implementation. First, regarding representation during mediation. We need to reconsider some regulatory restrictions placed on workers as they go through this process. Currently, union members cannot be represented during discussions – whilst executives have an even more limited representation. For workers who are not union members, they will certainly need more support. Additionally, I would also urge that young workers be given more support so that they do not easily suffer discrimination due to lack of experience and knowledge. Second, on the issue of time limits and extensions. Workers who have been dismissed need to file for mediation within just one month from their last day. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have met with several such individuals during Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS). Typically, they are in desperate situations and they say that the one-month period is too short. Among other things, I urge that a discretionary approach could be considered in accepting late applications, if there are reasonable grounds. Third, relating to the implementation of the complaint handling process. Since employers need to have internal complaints procedures, we need to ensure that HR officers in companies have adequate training. This is especially important for small and medium enterprises, where their staff may lack the capability to handle the complaint processes properly. Mr Deputy Speaker, finally, we need to address a significant gap in this Bill, namely outsourced workers. The Workplace Fairness Act (WFA) does not cover contract workers, platform workers, and outsourced workers. They are the group that is most vulnerable to discrimination. I urge that a framework be established to extend protection to outsourced workers. This will ensure fairer employment practices for all categories of workers. (In English)  Mr Deputy Speaker, the Workplace Fairness (Dispute Resolutions) Bill is a welcome development. However, for it to truly deliver justice, we must ensure that vulnerable workers can access representation, that time limits accommodate genuine hardships, that employers, especially SMEs, have the capacity to implement proper processes, and that our most vulnerable workers, including those outsourced, are not left behind. I call on the Ministry to address these concerns so that the promise of the workplace fairness becomes a reality for all workers in Singapore. Mr Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding the questions and concerns that I presented earlier, I support this Bill."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

In Mandarin, please. (In Mandarin)  Today, I wish to borrow an old saying from Chinese history to reflect on Singapore's future  \"In the land of Shu, there were no great generals, so Liao Hua had to serve as the vanguard.\" This saying is not just a historical reference – it serves as a stark warning for us today. This phrase comes from the period of the Three Kingdoms. In its later years, the Kingdom of Shu faced a severe shortage of talent. Zhuge Liang had passed away, and Jiang Wei was struggling to hold things together. Eventually, with limited military strength, Shu had to appoint Liao Hua – an ageing and less capable officer – as its vanguard. Later generations lamented  when a nation or team lacks capable people, it will have no one to turn to at critical moments. Although the original saying carries a tone of irony and helplessness, we should treat it today as a wake-up call. If a country fails to continually nurture talent and establish a robust leadership succession system, it risks being unprepared when crisis strikes. Singapore must never repeat such a mistake. The current state of the world is deeply concerning – recurring political violence in the United States, severely testing its democratic system; continuous disputes between left and right wings in Europe; frequent changes in leadership in Japan and South Korea, leading to a lack of policy continuity and stability; major electoral recalls and social divisions in Taiwan, severely damaging trust between the government and the people; ongoing political disputes following elections in several Southeast Asian countries; endless conflicts in the Middle East and the Russo-Ukrainian war, with peace nowhere in sight. All of this reminds us – political stability is not inevitable; it is a fragile asset that can easily be lost. In stark contrast, Singapore stands out. We have just completed a smooth, stable and mature leadership transition. The Prime Minister has changed, but policies remain consistent; the nation's direction continues and public confidence remains strong. Amid global turmoil, Singapore's institutions, culture and mutual trust have forged this hard-won stability. This is our advantage and also our responsibility. The President emphasised the importance of unity in his address, a point that I believe is crucial. The political atmosphere is like the air we breathe; fresh air goes unnoticed and unappreciated, but once it lacks harmony and becomes polluted, everyone feels suffocated. The concept of \"harmony\" or \"hé\", as advocated by Confucius, signifies a genuine, principled harmony, and not soulless, superficial conformity. This \"hé\" refers to harmonious and dedicated efforts towards the common, supreme goal of national development and the people's welfare. We must maintain a high degree of consensus on this major objective. This is the foundation upon which we can pool our strengths and accomplish great things. This is the \"harmony of the gentleman\", a unity stemming from shared ideals and beliefs. In this Parliament, we encourage constructive debate. However, if the purpose is to deliberately create confrontation for political gain, while disregarding the overall national development, this closely resembles what Confucius criticised as \"conformity without harmony\". This is why the President and the Prime Minister have repeatedly reminded us that true democracy is not \"me first,\" but \"we first.\" This is the most valuable aspect of Singapore's political culture. The greatest challenge the world faces today is not economic or military – it is the crisis of social cohesion. Individualism and a \"me first\" mindset are eroding the foundations of many societies. Singapore must choose a different path. To build a “we first” society, politically, all parties must prioritise the national interest, transcending partisan disputes. In policy, people should not only ask, \"What is in it for me?\" but also, \"Is this fair for our society?\" In daily life, we must care for one another, leaving no one behind. The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) has a special role to play in this. I believe the Ministry should lead this paradigm shift from \"me\" to \"we\", redefining our social compact through three key areas. Community building must go beyond festive events and occasional activities. We need to establish deep community connectivity programmes, encouraging residents to not only to know each other as neighbours, but to become mutual support systems; develop Community Shared Spaces 2.0 – transforming them into real living labs, not just physical spaces; and create intergenerational collaboration projects, bringing the young and old together to solve community problems, facilitating the exchange of wisdom and innovation. MCCY should lead this effort, shifting community building from activity-based projects to building a relational ecosystem. We need not merely law-abiding citizens, but community members who actively contribute. This requires redesigning national education to emphasise that citizens are not only rights-bearers, but also responsibility-takers; developing a grassroots community service framework so that volunteerism becomes a part of life, not just an occasional activity; and creating multicultural competency programmes to equip Singaporeans with the skills to thrive in a diverse society. Here, I must place special emphasis on the crucial role of the younger generation. The hope and impetus for building a \"we first\" society lie with our youth. They are not just future successors; they are a vital force in shaping the social fabric of the present. Young people are intellectually active, full of ideals, and possess a natural affinity for fairness, justice and sustainable development. We must create greater space for them, closely integrating their energy and creativity with our shared vision for the future. Specifically, first, we must genuinely listen to and trust our youth. Our engagement cannot be merely symbolic. We must substantively incorporate their ideas into policy considerations. When formulating long-term plans, the voices of young people must be heard and their suggestions should have the opportunity to be translated into concrete actions. Second, we must empower our youth to be the protagonists of community innovation. MCCY should support young people in independently launching projects that solve community problems, enabling their transition from being passive recipients of policy to active co-creators. This hands-on experience in building is the most effective way to foster a sense of ownership and belonging to the nation. Third, we must build solid bridges for intergenerational collaboration. A \"we first\" society requires understanding and continuity between generations. We should encourage the formation of mentorship groups, pairing youth with experienced seniors to jointly plan community projects. The combined experience and wisdom of the older generation with the drive and fresh perspectives of the young can create powerful synergies, ensuring both societal stability and vitality. Furthermore, in this age of fragmentation, we need common stories and shared memories more than ever  support projects that document and share \"Singapore Stories,\" focusing not only on national achievements, but also on the contributions of ordinary people, particularly stories of how the younger generation actively participates in and transforms communities. Develop community archives and digital platforms, allowing every community to preserve and share its history, and enabling youth to become a new force in recording and disseminating these stories. Create arts and cultural programmes that explore the evolving meaning of being Singaporean, encouraging young artists to interpret and enrich our shared identity from contemporary perspectives. These efforts, particularly through activating the proactive participation of our youth, will help us build a society that shares not just a common geographical space, but a profound sense of shared destiny. We must return to the saying with which I began  \"In the land of Shu, there were no great generals.\" It reminds us  to build a \"we first\" society, we must continuously nurture successors and encourage more young people to enter public service. We cannot rely only on a small elite – we must build a strong pipeline of talent, ensuring that there are always capable people ready to serve. Mr Speaker, Singapore may be small, but we can be bold, visionary and responsible. Building a \"we first\" society is not a Government programme – it is a national endeavour. It requires the participation and commitment of every Singaporean. Let us also cherish our hard-earned political stability and protect this valuable asset. Let us work together to maintain Singapore's precious political environment, ensure our political atmosphere remains clean, and enable future generations to grow up in a more united and prosperous Singapore.

This Bill continues the Government's careful and compassionate work to strengthen our national framework of long-term care, ensuring that no Singaporean faces the challenges of severe disability or extended care needs alone. It reaffirms our social compact, that as we build a more inclusive \"we first\" society, we also build systems that allow Singaporeans to age with dignity, security and peace of mind. For me, this Bill does two things. Firstly, it redefines the circumstances under which the CareShield Life Scheme applies by introducing a clear definition of \"not disabled\" in a new Fourth Schedule and by clarifying automatic coverage rules for individuals becoming Citizens or Permanent Residents after the scheme’s commencement. Secondly, it modernises the service of documents provisions, including a new section 61A that allows notices, such as demand notes, to be served through multiple channels, including email and approved digital platforms. This of course reflects the way that Singaporeans increasingly communicate, ensuring that administrative processes keep pace with technological advancements. These legislative enhancements coincide with significant policy shifts as well. In August 2025, the Government accepted the CareShield Life Council’s recommendations for the 2025 Review. These include higher payouts to meet long-term care needs and a $575 million in additional premium subsidies to cushion the increase for households. These changes ensure that CareShield Life remains financially sustainable while protecting Singaporeans who develop severe disabilities from being left behind. Mr Deputy Speaker, in Mandarin. (In Mandarin)  Mr Deputy Speaker, this amendment reflects that the Government's care for the elderly and persons with disabilities, and demonstrates our society's sense of responsibility and foresight when facing the challenges of an ageing population. As society rapidly ages, more and more families will face the pressure of long-term care. Whether due to age-related disability, or mobility difficulties caused by illness or accidents, long-term care is no longer \"someone else's problem\", but rather \"a common issue for all of us\". This amendment makes the definition of \"disability\" clearer and more consistent, whilst also ensuring that document servicing channels are more convenient and effective. Although these amendments appear to be technical, they concern whether families can receive timely assistance and protection in their caregiving journey. I also hope that when the Government implements electronic servicing, it can consider the actual circumstances of elderly people and vulnerable groups, avoiding situations where they miss important information due to the digital divide. We can combine physical letters with social media to ensure no information is missed. Most importantly, we must continue to make \"dignified ageing\" our goal, establishing a reliable and compassionate long-term care system that allows every citizen to face the future with peace of mind. (In English)  While I support the Bill, I would like to raise a few clarifying questions and suggestions to strengthen its implementation. Firstly, on assessment criteria and appeals. On the new \"not disabled\" definition  some individuals have progressive or cognitive disabilities that do not neatly fit into the six ADLs. How will these cases be fairly assessed? Will MOH issue updated clinical guidance and ensure that our assessors receive the adequate training to apply the criteria consistently? Appeals processes should also be transparent and timely. Clearer public guidelines with case examples and possibly tele-assessments for bedridden patients will reduce stress for families. Secondly, on digital service and inclusion. The shift to digital service is practical, but many affected groups are seniors with limited digital literacy. How will MOH ensure that they are not disadvantaged by missed notices? A \"phygital\" model should be the default for critical documents, such as demand notes. Community partners, such as the Silver Generation Office, the Infocomm Media Development Authority, media literacy ambassadors and the Community Development Councils (CDCs) can support vulnerable groups in managing their digital interactions. Thirdly, financial sustainability. The additional subsidies is commendable, but as payouts rise and our population ages, how stable will premiums remain over the longer term? Regular public actuarial reports, similar to CPF's, can build trust. MOH could also consider more progressive subsidies for middle-income families who may not qualify for help but still shoulder heavy caregiving burdens. CareShield Life also operates in conjunction with many other schemes such as the Home Caregiving Grant and Medisave withdrawals for long-term care. How will MOH ensure that families experience these as a coherent ecosystem, rather than fragmented programmes? A one-stop care portal perhaps, that integrates financial, medical and social services could be a meaningful difference for families navigating sudden disability events. On monitoring and review, what are the mechanisms that will be available to monitor the impact of these changes over the next few years? Regular publication of disability assessment data, appeals statistics and processing times will also strengthen transparency. Ultimately, social and health initiatives often compete for limited fiscal space and must demonstrate measurable outcomes within short cycles. Yet, long-term care, by its very nature, requires patient sustained investment in our caregivers, in community infrastructure, and preventative programmes. We must continue to find ways to bridge support gaps through deeper partnership, flexible funding models and a mindset that sees care not as a cost but as a shared responsibility and a social investment in our collective future. CareShield Life is also ultimately very important as part of our care framework. But by its very nature, it is abstract and its technical design makes it difficult for many to understand. Compared to ordinary health insurance, disability-type insurance is less intuitive to many people. It is hard to internalise eligibility criteria, payout triggers, limitations on how premiums evolve. And therefore, this requires much more public education. And I do urge the Ministry to continually inform and educate our public on the importance of CareShield Life and how it operates. By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 or above. The CareShield Life Scheme is a key pillar of our response to this demographic transformation. This Bill is not merely about technical amendments, but it is about how families experience vulnerability, care and experience dignity. I therefore support this Bill and I believe the suggestions that I raised today can make a good Bill even better."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

It is neither desirable for our community spirit nor sustainable for Government to step in as a first response for all disputes between neighbours. The Community Relations Unit (CRU) framework strikes a balance between Government stepping in to manage a dispute and leaving enough room for neighbours to settle disputes themselves. It is not a panacea for neighbour disputes and it is not a substitute for a strong foundation of positive community norms, good neighbourly relations and community dispute resolution options. CRU has a range of investigatory and enforcement powers, including the power to install noise sensors. These noise sensors are used as a confirmatory tool, after CRU's initial investigations narrow down from which unit the noise nuisance might be coming from. In the five cases in the pilot town of Tampines that CRU has investigated since April this year, noise sensors were not required because either the noisemakers gave formal statements that confirmed they were the source of noise, or the source of noise was clear and unambiguous. The CRU framework is a useful step forward but its implementation requires significant amounts of resources. Therefore, it is piloted in one town first, Tampines, focusing on severe neighbour noise and hoarding cases. We are reviewing this pilot carefully, to ensure our systems and processes are effective and we have resourced it correctly and sustainably before we extend the CRU services to other towns. As Minister Edwin Tong and the Senior Minister of State Sim Ann explained in their Second Reading speeches in November 2024, CRU focuses on severe cases that frontline agencies, like the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and the Police, triage and escalate to it. These cases represent a small proportion of all disputes between neighbours. They can include cases where one neighbour is deliberately making excessive noise at unreasonable hours and/or over prolonged periods to cause suffering to surrounding neighbours and where prior mediation has not been successful. Severe cases with a mental health nexus are another example. Of the three mental health-related cases CRU is dealing with, it has facilitated inpatient admission and treatment for one, and more consistent follow-up with the community for the other two. The one case involving deliberate use of noise to disturb neighbours and not related to mental health has abated after joint intervention by CRU, the Police and the Town Council. CRU will continue to take on severe cases in Tampines that frontline agencies escalate to it. As a deterrent and a last resort after exhausting all levers, CRU may refer the most severe and recalcitrant nuisance-makers to HDB, to consider compulsory acquisition of their flats. We will take this course of action only after due care and careful consideration. For new Build-To-Order (BTO) developments since February 2023, HDB has increased the thickness of floor slabs to 200 millimetres. This has reduced inter-floor noise transmission by up to five decibels. For existing flats, the scope for major infrastructure changes is limited. Nevertheless, residents can practise simple steps to reduce inter-floor noise. They can for example, place rubber padding or \"chair socks\" on the legs of furniture. HDB will also continue to explore other possible solutions through research and development. Overall, the average monthly volume of neighbour noise feedback in HDB estates, across Singapore, over the past five years has held steady at about 2,500. HDB does not otherwise track the number of disputes between neighbours in HDB flats, or the number of cases that escalated into physical altercations. Ultimately, we need strong community bonds and strong community norms, so fewer disputes will arise. And where they do arise, parties involved are more likely to resolve their differences in an amicable and mutually acceptable manner, if these norms and practices are strong. This is an outcome worth working towards as a \"we first\" society."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

In many cases, a speaker may mention an existing policy or one suggested by another speaker, but not necessarily agree with it. They may mention it to segue into a different topic, to ask questions about it, or even to disagree with it. This should not be included in the speaker's list of positions, since they did not advocate for it. Remember that your job is to list positions that the speaker expressed, not simply to summarize what they said.\n\nAdhere strictly to the following writing style: \n\n1. Use concise language but liberally include specifics of policies if they are present, rather than summarizing them generically. If necessary, always choose detail over succinctness.\n\n2.

Regardless of whatever we do, there is no 100% guarantee. You apply CDRT, CMC, or even to that regard, CRU, to any of these cases, it can help, it can also hinder, and in certain cases as well, it may even exacerbate the situation. So, there is no special power that CRU has and so, let us exercise reason. Let us exercise reason to it and recognise that there is no tool that is perfect and recognise that we have a useful suite of tools that are available to us, thanks to the enhanced CDMF. And we are using those tools and we are using novel tools in the Tampines pilot with regard to the CRU as well as the MD, but there is no perfect tool in this regard. And so, there is no special power. But what CRU does is help to be an intermediary, between voluntary mediation as well as enforcement. And that is what it is purporting to do. In the November 2024 Second Reading, I think, many Members of this House, from across both aisles, have naturally asked for the expansion of CRU beyond the Tampines pilot. I understand that and I am no exception. In fact, I think that was one of the biggest asks across. Can I ask and can I also request for Members to understand this  that this is a pilot, we have done this for six months in Tampines and it is resource intensive. We are now only six months into this one-year pilot. There are five cases. And we will continue to take on severe cases in Tampines that are being floated to, or raised or triaged by the agencies. But I ask for some patience. We are studying this pilot very carefully, sizing it very carefully and where appropriate, we will expand this pilot. At this point, I also wanted to remind Members in the Second Reading last year that Ms Sylvia Lim had also asked for the expansion of the CRU pilot, amongst many other Members in this House. But what is also very useful is that Members of this House also acknowledged two things. One, is that this is a multi-year effort by several Ministries and agencies, and I thank Members for duly acknowledging that. But the more important point is that Ms Sylvia Lim, while asking like many Members to expand the CRU pilot, she had also acknowledged the resource-intensive and challenging nature of the work. I quote Ms Lim, she said, \"It is also clear that the enhanced CDMF will be a resource-intensive exercise requiring standby teams after office hours and active management of difficult cases by the new Director-General of Community Relations. The work will not be easy.\" And I thought this is just useful for us. Give us some time. Let us study the pilot. We are working very hard on learning from the five cases that we have in Tampines. I have given, in my reply, the outcomes of these CRU cases in Tampines. And we are also looking at cases outside of Tampines, that some Members have also floated to us. Taken together, we are able to then look at how best to resource this and then extend it to beyond Tampines, when it is appropriate."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

How many referral cases do we want to have and how many serious cases we want to have? And I think, the Member would agree with me that we would ideally have less cases. Ideally. I mean, you would because at the upstream you would have addressed them – but let me respond to this. The fact is that we are looking at all of these five cases. We have seen some encouraging signs within all of these different five cases that the CRU has already addressed and we are studying these very carefully for us to see what we can do. I also want to take this opportunity to say that the CRU officers – I mean earlier on, the Member Kenneth Tiong, also mentioned that you have how many different officers, and then why are there just five cases? My officers at the CRU have worked very hard on these cases. They have devoted time. And as the Member would appreciate, these are very complicated cases and that is exactly why these are severe cases that have been referred to by HDB and the Police. If they are normal cases that are easily managed in the community or in CMC or other measures, then they would not have been.

President Tharman's call for unity, inclusivity and resilience deeply resonates with me, because these are not abstract ideals but real challenges we see on the ground. His Address is a timely reminder that while policies set the direction, it is a collective effort of Government, businesses, unions and our communities that will determine whether every Singaporean feels supported and included in this journey. I am committed to do my part in Parliament and in my Nanyang division to help translate this vision into reality for our people. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have stood in this House on at least six occasions since 2021, to sound the alarm and plead for stronger action against the notorious rise of vaping. At that time, the burden of enforcement fell almost entirely on the shoulders of the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), an agency I believed was not sufficiently resourced to combat this growing crisis. My belief was strengthened when I saw the dangerous infiltration of illicit products like Kpods into our schools and communities, and the possible involvement of criminal syndicates in trafficking vapes and Kpods. So, it was with a profound sense of relief that I, along with many concerned Singaporeans, listened to President saying that \"we must guard dangers at home, including vape\". Similarly, Prime Minister Mr Lawrence Wong had earlier voiced his concerns about vaping, especially those laced with harmful substances, during the National Day Rally. He affirmed the urgent need for stronger enforcement and harsher penalties. And true to his word, swift and decisive action followed, powerfully backed by our dedicated Home Team officers, working closely with MOH and HSA officers. What we are seeing now is the strength of a whole-of-Government response. A united front involving MOH, Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and MINDEF, is working to detect smuggling, and to protect our young people in schools, Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and army camps. While I deeply wish this decisive move had come sooner to curb vaping's nasty spread, I am, nonetheless, grateful, for in matters of public health and safety, it is always better late than never. This very success, which demonstrates what we can achieve when agencies work in concert, brings me to my next point, the critical importance of seamless coordination within our Government to truly serve our people. We have come a long way since the famous \"fish ball stick issue\" was first raised in by then-backbencher Ms Low Yen Ling and mentioned by then-Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong during his National Day Rally in 2014. Today, Ms Low Yen Ling is a Senior Minister of State, and inter-agency coordination has undoubtedly improved. Yet, some stubborn challenges remain. Let me share an example of the challenges we face in the fight against pest birds, whether they are pigeons, mynas, or crows. Recently, Nanyang has seen more of such birds, and I believe many other parts of Singapore face the same issue. When I noticed people feeding birds, which technically counts as littering, I referred the matter to the National Environment Authority (NEA). But NEA explained that they only handle high-rise littering, such as when food is thrown from windows to feed the birds. On the issue of bird control, they told me it is not under their purview and referred me to the National Parks Board (NParks). When I approached NParks, I was told that they mainly manage pigeons. For crows, they would request the Town Council to remove nests from trees. As for birds scavenging for food waste, responsibility depends on location. When the birds eat on the food waste in hawker centres, NEA steps in. If it happens at coffee shops, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) takes charge. If it happens at food courts in industrial estates, then JTC Corp is responsible – and the list goes on. So, here is my question. If NParks is the main agency responsible for pest bird management, and this is clearly an island wide issue, would it not make sense for NParks to set up a taskforce with NEA, Town Councils, HDB, JTC and other relevant partners, so that efforts can be coordinated instead of fragmented? Surely, we should not need to escalate this, the fight against bird nuisance to our Defence Minister, who is also the Coordinating Minister for Public Services, to lead the war against bird nuisance. Someone suggested we could consult ChatGPT. But, of course, ChatGPT or generative AI cannot chase away the birds for us. But it remains an important tool to help us tackle everyday challenges. During my recent trip to China, I once again saw first-hand how technology is transforming daily life, from sophisticated self-driving functions in mass-market electric cars to simple voice commands that can open curtains or switch off lights in a modest three-star hotel, technology has touched everyone's lives. What I witnessed shows us the true potential of AI. It can amplify human creativity, solve problems once thought impossible, and unlock entirely new levels of productivity. More than that, AI adoption creates new kinds of jobs, just like the rise of social media created opportunities for content creators and influencers. Yet, we must also acknowledge the very real concern that AI may displace jobs. As tasks become streamlined, some roles will inevitably be lost and this is where our greatest challenge and our deepest responsibility lie. We must embrace technology but also ensure no one is left behind. We must not see displaced workers as collateral damage. They are our partners in this transition. Beyond the measures already introduced by the Government and our unions, I believe we can and must do more to support workers who may be displaced by generative AI adoption. Firstly, we need to strengthen lifelong learning not just as a policy, but as a culture. Workers must feel empowered, not fearful, when faced with new technology. Instead of asking, \"Will AI take my job?\", we should encourage them to ask, \"How can I use AI to do my job better?\" Secondly, let us look into community-based learning hubs. Just as we have libraries and community centres in every town, why not also create AI learning spaces, where residents, regardless of age or background, can get hands-on exposure to digital tools, guided by trainers and volunteers? This makes reskilling accessible at the heart of every neighbourhood. Thirdly, we must build stronger partnerships with industry. Companies that adopt AI should not just think about profits and productivity. They should also take responsibility to retrain their workers, so that technology uplifts people rather than leaves them behind. Finally, we should encourage and celebrate second careers. A displaced worker does not mean a discarded worker. With the right training, a driver today could become a remote controller of autonomous vehicles tomorrow; a cashier could become a digital customer service specialist; a technician could become an AI maintenance trainer. Each career transition is not an end, but a new beginning. Mr Speaker, Sir, whether it is the fight against vaping, the nuisance of pest birds, or the disruption of AI, one lesson is clear. No challenge can be solved alone. Our strength lies in people working together  the Government, the unions, the businesses and communities. With unity and courage, we can turn every challenge into opportunity, protect every worker and ensure every Singaporean has a place in the future."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

President Tharman's call for unity, inclusivity and resilience deeply resonates with me, because these are not abstract ideals but real challenges we see on the ground. His Address is a timely reminder that while policies set the direction, it is a collective effort of Government, businesses, unions and our communities that will determine whether every Singaporean feels supported and included in this journey. I am committed to do my part in Parliament and in my Nanyang division to help translate this vision into reality for our people. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have stood in this House on at least six occasions since 2021, to sound the alarm and plead for stronger action against the notorious rise of vaping. At that time, the burden of enforcement fell almost entirely on the shoulders of the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), an agency I believed was not sufficiently resourced to combat this growing crisis. My belief was strengthened when I saw the dangerous infiltration of illicit products like Kpods into our schools and communities, and the possible involvement of criminal syndicates in trafficking vapes and Kpods. So, it was with a profound sense of relief that I, along with many concerned Singaporeans, listened to President saying that \"we must guard dangers at home, including vape\". Similarly, Prime Minister Mr Lawrence Wong had earlier voiced his concerns about vaping, especially those laced with harmful substances, during the National Day Rally. He affirmed the urgent need for stronger enforcement and harsher penalties. And true to his word, swift and decisive action followed, powerfully backed by our dedicated Home Team officers, working closely with MOH and HSA officers. What we are seeing now is the strength of a whole-of-Government response. A united front involving MOH, Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and MINDEF, is working to detect smuggling, and to protect our young people in schools, Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and army camps. While I deeply wish this decisive move had come sooner to curb vaping's nasty spread, I am, nonetheless, grateful, for in matters of public health and safety, it is always better late than never. This very success, which demonstrates what we can achieve when agencies work in concert, brings me to my next point, the critical importance of seamless coordination within our Government to truly serve our people. We have come a long way since the famous \"fish ball stick issue\" was first raised in by then-backbencher Ms Low Yen Ling and mentioned by then-Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong during his National Day Rally in 2014. Today, Ms Low Yen Ling is a Senior Minister of State, and inter-agency coordination has undoubtedly improved. Yet, some stubborn challenges remain. Let me share an example of the challenges we face in the fight against pest birds, whether they are pigeons, mynas, or crows. Recently, Nanyang has seen more of such birds, and I believe many other parts of Singapore face the same issue. When I noticed people feeding birds, which technically counts as littering, I referred the matter to the National Environment Authority (NEA). But NEA explained that they only handle high-rise littering, such as when food is thrown from windows to feed the birds. On the issue of bird control, they told me it is not under their purview and referred me to the National Parks Board (NParks). When I approached NParks, I was told that they mainly manage pigeons. For crows, they would request the Town Council to remove nests from trees. As for birds scavenging for food waste, responsibility depends on location. When the birds eat on the food waste in hawker centres, NEA steps in. If it happens at coffee shops, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) takes charge. If it happens at food courts in industrial estates, then JTC Corp is responsible – and the list goes on. So, here is my question. If NParks is the main agency responsible for pest bird management, and this is clearly an island wide issue, would it not make sense for NParks to set up a taskforce with NEA, Town Councils, HDB, JTC and other relevant partners, so that efforts can be coordinated instead of fragmented? Surely, we should not need to escalate this, the fight against bird nuisance to our Defence Minister, who is also the Coordinating Minister for Public Services, to lead the war against bird nuisance. Someone suggested we could consult ChatGPT. But, of course, ChatGPT or generative AI cannot chase away the birds for us. But it remains an important tool to help us tackle everyday challenges. During my recent trip to China, I once again saw first-hand how technology is transforming daily life, from sophisticated self-driving functions in mass-market electric cars to simple voice commands that can open curtains or switch off lights in a modest three-star hotel, technology has touched everyone's lives. What I witnessed shows us the true potential of AI. It can amplify human creativity, solve problems once thought impossible, and unlock entirely new levels of productivity. More than that, AI adoption creates new kinds of jobs, just like the rise of social media created opportunities for content creators and influencers. Yet, we must also acknowledge the very real concern that AI may displace jobs. As tasks become streamlined, some roles will inevitably be lost and this is where our greatest challenge and our deepest responsibility lie. We must embrace technology but also ensure no one is left behind. We must not see displaced workers as collateral damage. They are our partners in this transition. Beyond the measures already introduced by the Government and our unions, I believe we can and must do more to support workers who may be displaced by generative AI adoption. Firstly, we need to strengthen lifelong learning not just as a policy, but as a culture. Workers must feel empowered, not fearful, when faced with new technology. Instead of asking, \"Will AI take my job?\", we should encourage them to ask, \"How can I use AI to do my job better?\" Secondly, let us look into community-based learning hubs. Just as we have libraries and community centres in every town, why not also create AI learning spaces, where residents, regardless of age or background, can get hands-on exposure to digital tools, guided by trainers and volunteers? This makes reskilling accessible at the heart of every neighbourhood. Thirdly, we must build stronger partnerships with industry. Companies that adopt AI should not just think about profits and productivity. They should also take responsibility to retrain their workers, so that technology uplifts people rather than leaves them behind. Finally, we should encourage and celebrate second careers. A displaced worker does not mean a discarded worker. With the right training, a driver today could become a remote controller of autonomous vehicles tomorrow; a cashier could become a digital customer service specialist; a technician could become an AI maintenance trainer. Each career transition is not an end, but a new beginning. Mr Speaker, Sir, whether it is the fight against vaping, the nuisance of pest birds, or the disruption of AI, one lesson is clear. No challenge can be solved alone. Our strength lies in people working together  the Government, the unions, the businesses and communities. With unity and courage, we can turn every challenge into opportunity, protect every worker and ensure every Singaporean has a place in the future."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

In 2012, I stood in this House to speak up for our Bus Captains, to raise a concern close to my heart. At that time, we had a glaring inconsistency  if a passenger brought a dangerous item on board a bus, the Bus Captain, not the passenger, faced a penalty. Yet, for the same offence on our trains, the passenger was held accountable. This was not just a policy gap. It was a profound injustice for the hardworking men and women at the wheel. I was relieved and thankful when the Ministry moved decisively to rectify this anomaly with the advent of the Bus Contracting Model. Now, with section 42AB of the Bus Services Industry (Amendment) Bill, it is clearly the responsibility of the bus passenger not to bring dangerous items on board the bus. The Bus Contracting Model was a watershed moment because it forced a fundamental shift in perspective. With the Bus Contracting Model, LTA took direct ownership of bus service levels and the results have been transformative. Service improved significantly. Crucially, the first tender set a new and strong benchmark focused on quality and service, not just the lowest cost. However, a concerning trend has since emerged. From 2015 to 2024, almost all the bus packages have been awarded based on the lowest or second-lowest price. And the service fee per kilometre has also been a decreasing trend over the last decade. While this has driven apparent cost efficiency, even as Bus Captains' starting pay rightly rose from just over $2,000 a month in 2013 to about $4,000 a month today, we must ask  how far can we push this? There is a limit to efficiency. Internationally, in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia, similar systems have shown a tipping point exists. It seems that we may also have reached our tipping point. The recent Tampines bus package was awarded not to the lowest bidder, but to an operator with the highest bid, significantly higher than its competitors. While we are not privy to the award considerations, it would be worthwhile that we review the trajectory of the Bus Contracting Model and send a clear signal to the industry insofar on how the various operators should gear themselves up to service and support Singapore’s bus transport needs. Next, I would like to address the issue that weighs heavily on the minds of many Singaporeans  the high Certificate of Entitlement (COE) prices. The COE is the big elephant in the room of our transport sector. With Category A prices recently hitting record highs, the COE revenue for the Ministry in 2025 is projected to dwarf the $4.7 billion collected in 2024. To put this in perspective, the entire operating expenditure of MOT was only $2.5 billion in 2024, as compared to the COE revenue of $4.7 billion in the same year. Currently, all this substantial revenue flows into the Government’s consolidated fund. For the Singaporean who dreams of owning a car but is priced out by these sky-high COEs, this creates a painful disconnect. They see a system that generates immense revenue from a good they cannot afford, with no direct benefit to their daily commute. To bridge this gap and restore a sense of fairness, I propose the Government consider establishing a dedicated COE-PT (Public Transport) Fund. This fund could earmark a percentage of COE revenue specifically to enhance our public transport ecosystem, over and above the existing MOT operating budget. In this way, for those who would not be able to afford a private car, they will see a continuous improvement to the public transport system, one which will continually be safe and reliable, and that they can fully rely on for their daily commute needs. This COE-PT Fund could be used to firstly, directly offset a portion of the annual public transport fare increases decided by the PTC, easing the financial burden on every commuter. A portion of the fund could also be used for the much-needed asset renewals across the public transport ecosystem, addressing Life Cycle Management needs, especially our train systems. This will keep our systems functioning safely and reliably, well into the future. Secondly, the fund can also be used to accelerate the building of covered linkways, ensuring a more comfortable and sheltered journey from our Housing and Development Board flats to MRT stations and bus stops. Thirdly, the fund can also bolster for low-income families through enhanced Public Transport Voucher schemes. Today, for the household to qualify for Public Transport Vouchers, the monthly household income per person cannot be more than $1,800. With the COE-PT Fund, we can have more resources to allow households with orange Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) cards, that is, households with monthly income per person of not more than $2,300 to also qualify for the Public Transport Voucher. With the COE-PT Fund, even those who cannot own a car would see a tangible, direct benefit from the COE system. It would partly take the sting out of the high COE prices and demonstrate that the system is designed to support all Singaporeans. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have spoken candidly today out of a deep care for our public transport system and for the people it serves. My observations are meant to be constructive.

Secondly, what is the plan to expand this cross-border taxi service to private hire cars?

And thirdly, when the Senior Minister of State says that LTA wants to increase the number of drop-off points in Malaysia and Singapore – currently, there is only one drop-off point in Johor Bahru and it is in Larkin; and in Singapore, there is one drop-off point – how many drop-off points is MOT thinking of having?

Thank you, Senior Minister of State Sun for the comprehensive reply. Before I go on, let me declare I am the CEO of Strides Premier, a company that provides cross-border taxi service as well. I have a few supplementary questions. First of all, what is the plan that LTA has to expand the fleet of 200 cross-border taxis to more, and whether it will allow the application by a taxi driver on a monthly basis, rather than restrict it to once a year? Secondly, what is the plan to expand this cross-border taxi service to private hire cars? Because private hire cars' pricings are quite dynamic and as pointed out by the Senior Minister of State, the operating cost of driving a P2P vehicle in Johor Bahru is a small fraction of what is the cost in Singapore. So, how would MOT consider measures to prevent the undercutting of fares in this matter? And thirdly, when the Senior Minister of State says that LTA wants to increase the number of drop-off points in Malaysia and Singapore – currently, there is only one drop-off point in Johor Bahru and it is in Larkin; and in Singapore, there is one drop-off point – how many drop-off points is MOT thinking of having? Is it five? Is it 10 or is it 20?"}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

This allows both cyclists and pedestrians to share the path, typically at a width of 2.5 metres. Clear logos and wordings guide users at areas of potential interaction between pedestrians and cyclists, and to signal transitions between POPs and shared paths. To enhance pedestrian safety, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) works with relevant agencies to implement additional safety measures, such as installation of convex mirrors at locations with line-of-sight issues, additional lighting and trimming of overgrown hedges that narrow the paths. LTA conducts education campaigns and community engagement programmes regularly to promote gracious path sharing and safe behaviour. Since August 2024, LTA’s active mobility enforcement officers have been on the ground to educate users on the safe use of the segregated paths, ahead of the commencement of the POP rule on 1 July 2025. Enforcement officers conduct regular patrols to ensure adherence to the path segregation of cycling paths and POPs.

In the case of POPs, it is relatively new since July 2025. So, the rule is that cyclists or riders are not supposed to go on POPs. But if there are instances, for example, where the cyclist or rider needs to temporarily overtake a slow-moving cyclist on the cycling path and then venture for that instance on the POP, that will not be counted as an offence, because that is understandable as long as he does it in a safe manner, by looking out for other users of the POP. But when it is obvious that the cyclist or rider is blatantly riding on POPs, without safe regard for other users, over extended distances, then that definitely will be an offence, and the enforcement officers will issue fines. In fact, since 1 July 2025, about five fines have been issued for such errant riders. On the recourse, under the Active Mobility Act, when accidents happen, the cyclist or rider are supposed to stop and render assistance. In cases where the riders are performing work-related rides, like doing delivery, they are also required to have third-party liability insurance, so that would also cater for any claims for injury. On licensing riders or cyclists and vehicles or bicycles, many years ago, Singapore does require registration of bicycles, but it has become a very laborious exercise because bicycles are passed down within families, from people to people, and it becomes an administrative hassle to have to update, not only for the authorities, but for owners of bicycles. We also take reference from practices and learnings from other countries in the world. Therefore, we have stopped that. It is also not easy to license riders because riders span a spectrum of different ages, from the very young to the very old. So, we focus on educational campaigns and rules for riding behaviour. That is more sustainable and we will keep on promoting that to ensure a safe riding landscape for Singaporeans. The Member had a last question about getting feedback on the ground. Yes, we continue to do that, on how better to design our paths, our cycling infrastructure. So, we will continue our engagements with advisors, grassroots leaders and other community groups.

So, if the users adhere to this code of conduct, we do allow the different users travelling at different speeds to co-exist harmoniously and safely. In areas where the paths are narrower – those are what we call footpaths – the speed limit has been lowered to 10 kilometres an hour. And on these paths, devices which are motorised cannot be used. That means, only manual bicycles could be used, as well as for users of personal mobility aids. That means, these are for people with mobility issues.

So, when the path is crowded, there are obstacles in front, a slower-moving device or user in front, they should slow down and give way to them. That is the expectation. And if there are cases where riders or cyclists had been reckless, they will be taken to task. I will just make a clarification to Mr Dennis Tan's supplementary question. When I said earlier, at a previous Sitting about allowing device users to overtake, these are for cases where there is a pedestrian-only path beside a cycling path. There is no pedestrian-only path beside a shared path.

Sir, I seek to raise two key areas for the Minister's clarification. The first is on the financial structure of the levy. It is accepted the high costs of SAF currently necessitates a measure and mechanism like this levy to support its initial adoption. However, I remain concerned that this policy decision appears to place the financial burden entirely upon passengers. I respectfully ask the Minister of State to justify the approach and explain the considerations behind the choice, not to implement a model of financial risk sharing with airlines or fuel suppliers, or direct volume metric mandate on these commercial entities, an approach which has been adopted in other jurisdictions, such as EU and UK. As this levy is passed on to consumers, we need clear assurance that their contribution is both effective and monitored. Flights from Singapore were previously estimated to increase by $3 to Bangkok; $6 to Tokyo and $16 to London. I would be grateful if the Minister of State could inform the House of the specific mechanisms and reporting protocols. CAAS was established to actively monitor these estimates and ensure that actual financial impact of the levy on ticket prices remains predictable and consistently aligns with the Ministry's initial projections. A crucial point for public confidence is technical basis for the cost difference. The Ministry has previously stated, including in its discussion in 2023 that SAF is currently more than three times the cost of conventional jet fuel, thereby being unsuitable for use by the Republic of Singapore Air Force and its aircrafts, like the F-16. Could the Minister of State provide more detailed elaboration on the methodology, including the specific fossil fuel benchmark used to assess how the cost of the banded fuel of jet fuel was calculated and substantiated to be more than three times that of Jet Propellant 8 (JP-8) fuel? Finally, we must leverage on our national strengths. Singapore is a major refining hub, home to significant self-production capacity, such as Neste's expanded facility. The Minister's assurance is sought on the strategy for how the presence of these advanced facilities will be utilised to bring the cost of SAF lower over time, rather than merely acting as a platform for centralised procurement and persistently high global market rates. Secondly, on the need for public accounting in its management. This SAF levy is a public contribution towards a critical national goal and the accompanying trust must be transparently maintained. While the blueprint indicates the fund will purchase SAF at its actual market price, the Bill is not explicit on public reporting obligations. I urge to consider establishing a clear formal reporting obligation for CAAS regarding the SAF Fund. Will the Ministry commit to publish a regular and comprehensive report for the public? Such a report should document the total levy collected and expended, the volume and cost of SAF purchase, the actual SAF uplift proportion achieved by airlines and, most importantly, the measurable environmental impact and carbon emissions reduction delivered by the fund. I commend the Ministry for this decisive step towards the long-term decarbonisation for our aviation industry.

This aligns with Singapore's history of strengthening laws against trends in crime. I support the Bill but seek clarification firstly on complementary social and support measures to tackle the scourge of scams between deterrence and dialogue. The Bill distinguishes money mules from scam syndicate leaders, introducing mandatory caning for scammers and discretionary caning for money mules. This toughens measures against scams, addressing a national issue. The message is clear, \"If you dare to scam Singaporeans, this is the price you pay.\" This move is crucial due to devastating losses  over $3.4 billion since 2019, with a record $1.1 billion in 2024. But beyond financial figures, victims have experienced ruined family relationships, depression and some even turned to suicide. Caning is, therefore, an effective deterrent in reducing loan shark harassment, but I have two clarifications on this. First is for those above 50 years old where caning is unsuitable, how will alternative penalties be applied? And whether these enhanced penalties will immediately apply to the 27 Singaporeans allegedly found to be part of the Cambodian scam syndicate, if found guilty? While the Bill assigns lower culpability to money mules, their punishment is still significant. I support the new offences but suggest new ways to augment the effectiveness. As criminal lawyers note, deterrence is not the only crime control method; focusing solely on increased penalties might ignore root issues. Mules might be financially disadvantaged, incentivised by financial hardship to sell Singpass details or personal access. A worrying trend involves youths becoming scam mules; and a misconception that only elderly are victims when those in the 21 to 59 age group, who might be digitally native and overconfident, thereby constituting most victims. Greater deterrence therefore may not address economic hardship or coercion, but our approach needs to be balanced, focusing on financial literacy and legitimate employment. Given the heavy penalties for potential money mules, public education on offence severity is needed, especially demographics of those less aware. We must also incorporate these messaging, using technology, like the ScamShield app, a powerful intelligence network against scam trends. Another suggestion includes encouraging money mules to become informants, aligning with Government efforts against local scam enablers, where those actively cooperating with authorities by providing information on scam operations could receive reduced sentencing. But often the investigation of potential money mules might be complex and lengthy. It is hard to distinguish those who participate as a mule versus those whose personal information might have been misused and compromised. During investigation, these individuals might face strict restrictions, including frozen bank accounts, affected credit ratings, making it hard to receive salaries, to pay bills or to receive Government benefits. This significantly impacts those already struggling financially. Can the Minister, therefore, clarify interim measures and collaborations with banks to support the increasing number of Singaporeans implicated in scam-related investigations but might not be convicted? Next, I will speak about strengthening protections for vulnerable victims against abuse. The Bill proposes increasing maximum jail term for fatal abuse of vulnerable victims from 20 years to life imprisonment of up to 30 years. This tool ensures penalties for the \"worst of the worst\" egregious cases. Despite serious penalties for abuse, advocates for vulnerable groups, like domestic helpers, highlight root causes lie in power disparity and victims' fear-driven difficulty in seeking help, sometimes due to social isolation. Increased abuse penalties also need to come with complementary protection and empowerment for potential victims, especially for early intervention. For example, migrant domestic worker abuse averaged 320 reports annually from 2020 to 2024. Existing support measures can be expanded through awareness of help avenues and increased checks on these foreign domestic workers. Enhanced penalties also apply to abuse of children under 14 and vulnerable persons. Beyond age, if I may suggest stipulating definitions of vulnerable persons for seniors or even those with disabilities using metrics, like the Activities of Daily Living score, which is an established tool for measuring functional ability. In conclusion, I strongly support this Bill's decisive move to address crime threats and introduce tougher penalties.

I stand in support of this Bill and offer three points for consideration. First, I acknowledge MOM's rationale for expanding the ECT monetary jurisdiction to S$250,000 for discrimination claims, a positive step for many PMEs. However, non-unionised workers are disadvantaged due to the inability to have legal representation during mediation or ECT proceedings, especially given the complexity of proving discrimination. While union members in non-unionised companies have access to Tripartite Mediation Advisers, a proportion may not and may struggle to understand the discrimination and the experiences or articulate the details of unfair treatment. Can the Minister clarify specific resources to support non-unionised workers through the ECT procedures? Second, I understand the position that Court proceedings would generally be held in private to foster open discussions without public misrepresentation. However, there is significant public interest in serious workplace discrimination cases and to hold employers accountable, the current Bill appears to offer limited discretion for the High Court to publish this information. Will the Minister confirm that the High Court's discretion to publish is flexible enough to ensure public accountability of employers found to have committed discriminatory acts, even without criminal prosecution, to avoid undermining the deterrence effect of this legislation? Third, I note that this Bill does not amend the scope of the Workplace Fairness Act, which excludes outsourced workers and freelancers, including platform workers. While the Bill covers about three-quarters of the local workforce, this excludes the 67,600 platform workers recorded in 2024. As the enhanced Bill comes into force, I look forward to seeing the Ministry reviewing these aspects of expanding protections to outsourced workers and freelancers. I commend the Government and congratulate all stakeholders, including NTUC, TAFEP and SNEF for their efforts in bringing this Bill and its dispute resolution mechanisms to fruition. This Bill is a tripartite win, demonstrating the collaborators' spirit of employers, unions and the Government in establishing clear roles and a robust framework for workplace fairness.

I would like to seek a few clarifications. The first is on Megan's case. The initial reporting of the case in the media kind of pinned the blame on the social service agency Beyond Social Services that was involved, and a few community and social practitioners actually spoke up on social media about the optics of the reporting. I think, retrospectively, the question is then, how can we better report or communicate when such tragedies happen, in light of also encouraging collective ownership and culture? My second question refers to conversations with preschool educators. On one hand, one anecdote was, as much as educators want to balance building rapport with parents and they do ask when they find injuries on the children and they need to ask in a polite and non-offensive way to just clarify how injuries that might have occurred when they bring their child to the centre. So, the question is  how does the Ministry help to support preschools in balancing this rapport with parents that preschool educators have to constantly balance? Another question by preschool educators was when a child with non-verbal or with special needs might present with injuries that parents may attribute to falls, that it is only the parents' account that is taken into consideration. What advice would we give to preschools to assess in those cases, how much of parents' accounts to believe and whether or not to make a report with NAVH, nevertheless? A last question from preschool educators is, after the abused child returns to a centre, they may also exhibit some of this abusive or violent or inappropriate behaviour to their peers as well. How can teachers be better prepared for these scenarios? My last supplementary question references an initiative by MSF and Koufu that was launched in August this year, where 77 food court managers were trained by MSF to be the eyes and ears of the community and highlight NAVH hotline and the work that they do. So, my question is, how do we expand such initiatives, like Minister Desmond Lee mentioned, the rings of concentric circles where a society's collective responsibility to protect the vulnerable?

A recent survey by MDDI found that in the past year, more than four in five Singapore residents encountered harmful online content across platforms, like Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, TikTok, X, Reddit, Telegram and WhatsApp. This highlights a clear and urgent need to enhance current mechanisms for help seeking relief. The Bill is, therefore, a crucial and timely step to ensure that the safety and civility we value in the physical world, on our streets, extend to our digital lives. An anecdote that Minister Edwin Tong had alluded to as well. An Institute of Policy Studies survey found that sexual content depicting voyeuristic or intimate images recorded without consent was overwhelmingly perceived as the most severe of online harms. Victims need fast action. The current reality, as an IMDA report revealed, is that major platforms often took five days or more to act appropriately on user reports of harmful content. For a victim whose intimate images have been non-consensually recorded and distributed publicly, five days can be catastrophic. I am, therefore, concerned about the need for timely relief and clarity of the administrative process for victims of online harm. The Bill rightly grants the Commissioner wide discretion to carry out its own investigation and empowers to issue legally enforceable directions to take down content and restrict accounts. I understand that it will take time and extensive consultations, after the appointment of the Commissioner and other relevant office holders, to formulate the detailed rules governing how the Commissioner may exercise investigative powers. I, therefore, seek clarification on the Commissioner's investigative process, specifically on the following questions Will the Commissioner publish advisory guidelines indicating the expected timelines for the investigation and resolution of a complaint, with processes put in place for urgent investigations to take place? Will the perpetrator being investigated be made aware of the investigation, and at what stage? What information will be disclosed to the perpetrator about the complaint made against them? I understand the Commissioner is already working with SHE in the design of this initiative, including referral to SHECARES@SCWO for counselling and pro bono legal advice. Will the Commissioner consider engaging other organisations who provide victim care and support, like AWARE's Sexual Assault Care Centre and Project X, to improve trauma-informed processes and joint case management and outreach to encourage more victims, especially those in minority communities, to be assured when seeking help. For victims under immense stress, clarity on the steps involved for bringing a complaint and the expected time for resolution is vital. With great power holds great responsibility, and the transparency of the process can help reassure and encourage help-seeking efforts. Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate how this Bill is a product of extensive consultation. A month-long public consultation on the proposed legislation, which received broad public support and directly informed the final Bill. Our citizens have asked for accountability and this Bill delivers. This legislation strikes a critical balance. It empowers the victim, yet holds the perpetrator accountable, and sets clear expectations for platforms. It is a necessary act of legislative fortitude to protect our citizens in an increasingly complex digital world.

I have met with residents affected by online harms and Singaporeans have written to me asking for reforms. From how we stay in touch to how we work, shop, learn and govern, the Internet has evolved into more than just a means of communication – it has become a second life. And the divide between the online and offline worlds continues to blur as technology becomes increasingly interwoven into our daily lives. Our laws need to keep pace with modern day advances and the threats of today. The recent report by SHE, \"404 Help Not Found  Lived Experiences of Online Harms Survivors\" sheds light on the harsh realities that define today’s digital landscape. Let me share the story of one of the online harms survivors mentioned in the report. As a child, Zane experienced bullying in school. His peers took to online platforms weekly to spread negative remarks about him. Later in life, during his polytechnic years, Zane experienced doxxing. The perpetrator shared his name, school and course on Twitter and threatened Zane. These incidents had an impact on Zane in his growing years. He kept his pain to himself, fearing retaliation and judgement. The emotional toll eventually caught up with him. During his National Service days, Zane experienced panic attacks and had to seek professional help. Zane's journey reflects how cumulative online harms can leave deep psychological scars; ones that linger long after the screen goes dark. And what happened to Zane is not rare. It is a glimpse into a culture where online harm has become casual, even accepted. Where cruelty hides behind screens, and victims often suffer in silence – many times too afraid, too tired and too ashamed to seek help. It is important for us to be deliberate in shaping the tone of our online world for our children, our friends and our neighbours. Because the wounds may be invisible, but they are real – and they last. The Bill is a step in the right direction. The OSC is vested with the authority to issue directions and orders to online service providers, communicators and administrators. Additionally, victims can turn to civil recourse and remedies for redress. In the age of AI, where false and harmful content can spread faster and cut deeper, such protections have never been more important. The youths in particular are particularly and especially vulnerable to online harms. To find out what the youths thought of the Bill, I spoke with YouthTech SG, formerly known as Cyber Youth Singapore. YouthTech SG is a youth-led social movement and charity. One of their divisions is YouthTech Institute which focuses on helping young people navigate the risks and opportunities of technology, including online safety. They wrote to me and expressed their support for the Bill, describing it as a signal for Singaporeans to foster a more cohesive, civil and wholesome digital environment. They also welcomed the Bill’s introduction of new avenues for youths to seek help and relief when harmed online; options that previously did not exist. While the Bill makes important strides in fostering a responsible digital environment, the online culture is ultimately one which requires users to build and that endeavour goes beyond legislation. Having reviewed the Bill, I find that the Bill is a meaningful step forward. It is unlikely to be a quick or perfect fix given how common online harms are and how deep rooted they are in our daily lives, but it signals our shared commitment to build a kinder, safer Singapore – both offline and online. I support this Bill and would like to share a few reflections and seek some clarifications. My first observation  the creation of the OSC and the scope of its enforcement powers is noteworthy. The speed of takedown is critical. While victims often suffer immediate harm, current means of redress are reportedly slow and sometimes ineffective. IMDA’s 2024 Online Safety Assessment Report found that major platforms acted appropriately only on half of the reported harmful content, often taking more than five days. The unfortunate reality is that victims are often left to navigate complex and sometimes opaque complaint processes, and structural challenges may further hinder platform responsiveness. The OSC plays a vital role in addressing these gaps. Its powers, such as issuing Stop Communication or Restraining Directions, enable victims to take timely and decisive steps to safeguard themselves. Moreover, clause 26(1) provides that the Commissioner may issue a Part 5 direction if the OSC has reason to suspect that the online harmful activity was conducted. This allows OSC the flexibility to swiftly take down online harmful activity. I see that Australia had similar experiences from which we can draw some lessons. The Australian eSafety Commissioner has the power to issue directives to address online harmful activities. Speaking at a 2023 symposium organised by MinLaw and the SMU Yong Pung How School of Law, the eSafety Commissioner from Australia highlighted the value of a dedicated and independent safety regulator in addressing online harms. In a Straits Times article, dated 26 September 2023, it was reported that she said  \"Often when people come to us, they just want their images taken down, they don’t want to be tethered to their former partner through litigation, which, of course, can take a long time. So, what we provide is rapid assistance. I don’t think we would have the same degree of success with the platforms, particularly where there are grey areas, if we didn’t have these (remedial) powers.\" To this extent, I note that there is a requirement for victims to first file a report to the online platform before approaching OSC. The duty imposed on the platforms also only starts when the report is accurately and properly filed to the platform. And therefore, the accessibility and ease of reporting on the platforms will be critical in ensuring access to justice for victims through OSC. I seek clarifications on how the Ministries plan to work with the platforms to enable this. Secondly, I also seek clarification if the same content appears across different platforms and sites, how should the victim take action? Should the victim report all incidences he or she is aware of at the same time? Are OSC's directions specific? Or will we land in a situation where the victim is required to repeatedly go through the process of reporting to the platform and then to OSC for each piece of material? Can a victim apply to OSC for the pre-emptive ban of similar materials resurfacing? Member Zhulkarnain had mentioned the advantages that OSC offers in being a more responsive and less adversarial mechanism as compared to traditional litigation. I will not repeat that, but I stand in support of his point. My second observation is on anonymity. Victims of online harm may be reluctant to seek redress due to fear of repercussions, whether from the perpetrator, societal stigma, workplace consequences, or familial pressures. This hesitation is particularly pronounced in cases involving intimate image abuse, doxxing, or harassment, where the victim’s identity is often central to the harm itself. I am heartened to see that the Ministry has been sensitive to this issue. In respect of court proceedings, the Bill envisages that the Rules of Court may be amended to empower the Court to order the redaction of identifying information, including parties' names, in court documents, to conduct proceedings in private, and to issue orders preventing the disclosure of parties’ or witnesses’ identities. I am concerned that in practice, however, victims may remain vulnerable and additional administrative steps may be required to secure their anonymity during the interim period before such orders are granted. I wish to suggest for the Minister's consideration whether a more victim-centric approach would be to introduce automatic redaction, subject to judicial discretion to lift such redaction where appropriate. This would mirror existing protections under the Children and Young Persons Act, where proceedings involving minors are automatically anonymised, and the Women’s Charter, which provides automatic identity protection in the form of prohibition of publication or broadcast of information identifying victims or witnesses. This is applied under the Women's Charter in cases involving sexual offences. Extending automatic anonymity to victims of online harm, particularly those from vulnerable groups, would not only reduce procedural burden but also encourage victims to avail themselves to the options under this Bill. Beyond the courtroom, I would be grateful for further clarity on how the Ministry intends to safeguard the confidentiality of victims during the reporting process. Specifically, how will the Ministry ensure that victims’ personal information remains protected, while also upholding the rights of alleged perpetrators to be informed of the nature of the allegations made against them? My third observation relates to the new statutory tort of online instigation of disproportionate harm. Clause 87 of the Bill, which introduces the \"tort of online instigation of disproportionate harm\", which is designed to offer civil recourse to victims and their associates where public statements, made in response to a victim’s conduct, are likely to incite others to act in ways that could cause harm to the victim. Civil action under this tort requires proof of actual or reasonably foreseeable loss or damage, while some heads of losses, such as financial losses, may be easier to prove, others, particularly psychological injury or emotional distress, have traditionally presented evidentiary challenges. I would be grateful for the Minister's clarification on how the latter cases will be treated. My fourth observation is that the Bill seeks to address \"inauthentic material abuse\", which is any audio, visual or audiovisual material that has been digitally altered or generated that is false or misleading depiction of the victim’s words, actions or conduct, but is realistic enough that a reasonable person would believe that the material emanated from the victim. In this regard, a depiction of the victim saying or engaging in anything includes a depiction of the victim’s likeness saying or engaging in that thing. The Bill would benefit from clarity on how likeness is assessed in the context of AI-generated content. For example, does resemblance alone suffice? Must there be an intent to impersonate or mislead? What evidentiary standards apply? In my view, these clarifications are especially important since resemblance may be subtle, stylised, or partial. In closing, Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome this Bill. It is a timely and necessary step towards preventing the propagation of online harmful activities. This is especially important today, when many of us, including young and old, spend much of our time online. The youths in particular are especially vulnerable to online harms, and I am heartened that this Bill provides additional avenues for their protection. In particular, I am encouraged by the Ministries’ efforts to consult widely and engage with the youths while drafting this Bill. The youths form a significant demographic that would be affected and protected by this Bill. In their letter to me, YouthTech Institute shared with me that they participated in the public consultations and dialogues organised by the Government. They voiced their concerns and provided feedback on how the Bill can continue to stay true to its policy goals without chilling legitimate online participation by youths. They tell me that their feedback was seriously taken in and considered. By participating in the drafting process of this legislation, our youths felt seen and heard, inspired and empowered. The youths had this to say  \"Thank you for showing us that policy can be made with us, not just for us.\" I am grateful to the Government for allowing the youth voices to be heard on a Bill that affects matters close to their hearts. I thank the Ministers and their teams for their efforts, and I am happy to support this Bill."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

To Mr Low Wu Yang Andre's question, employment rates are affected by various factors, such as economic and labour market conditions. Increases in public sector hiring in response to economic downturns will take the cue from the larger national response to economic conditions. In deciding whether to trigger further support for Singaporeans during an economic downturn, the Government closely monitors a range of economic indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product growth and sectoral value-added growth, as well as labour market indicators, such as unemployment rates, employment growth, retrenchments and polls, that track firms' hiring and wage expectations. Beyond specific trigger points based on the economic outlook, we also stay responsive to feedback on the ground to address specific concerns as they arise. Based on economic and labour market data for 2Q 2025, economic conditions remain stable, but this is set against a backdrop of some uncertainty as a result of trade tensions and geopolitical conflict. Mr Pritam Singh asked about the status of public sector hiring. Around 45% of the earlier projected 2,400 vacancies in the public sector have been filled. To increase awareness of the job opportunities in the public sector, we have expanded our outreach through additional efforts, such as the SG Public Service Career Fair held on 23 August 2025. The Fair attracted around 1,800 fresh graduates. There will continue to be new vacancies as needs of public agencies evolve. For example, more than 300 new vacancies for fresh graduates have been added as of 11 September 2025. We will continue to hire people with the right skills, values and attitudes to the Public Service, and we welcome capable and committed Singaporeans to come forward to take up the vacancies.

Both the F-35As and F-35Bs have advanced sensor suites, while the F-35Bs provide an additional short take-off and vertical landing capability. They complement the F-15SGs to maintain a strong fighter fleet to meet our operational requirements and safeguard our skies. MINDEF/SAF's capability acquisition approach for the F-35s and P-8As caters for the platforms' logistics and life cycle needs. For example, to assure long-term supportability, we account for the acquisition of spare parts, engineering support by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), and the establishment of local maintenance capability. The capability acquisition approach also ensures that our personnel will be trained well. For example, the initial batch of F-35 pilots will be trained by qualified United States Air Force (USAF) F-35 instructors. The RSAF will also establish a new training detachment in Ebbing Air National Guard Base to train alongside other partner nations operating the F-35s. Additionally, the SAF's P-8A and F-35 operators will have opportunities to train in exercises with partner nations who operate the same platforms. The specific training plans for the P-8A operators are currently being developed.

It is an honour for me, as a new Member to participate in this debate. When my son was a toddler, he walked up to the television and he scrolled across the screen as though it were a giant iPad. That simple moment captures the paradox of progress. As technology propels us forward, it also reshapes our psychology, our families and our society. The question before us is not whether we progress, but how we progress without losing our values and humanity. Our children today are born into a world of touchscreens and instant connectivity. They are more tech-savvy than us. They are growing up with Google Gemini, ChatGPT, generative AI and technologies not yet imagined. But, the ease of technology, however useful, always comes with trade-offs – especially for families. In Tampines East, many young parents tell me they struggle with these trade-offs. With long days spent juggling work, children and ageing parents, they are exhausted. And so, devices often become quick fixes. On the surface, we see children pacified with screens. But in truth, parents are simply trying to survive the day. Mr Speaker, Sir, technology not only changes how we live, more fundamentally, it shapes our psychology. And it is here that we must confront the deeper paradoxes of technology. We saw the rise of the \"Me Generation\" with the arrival of Facebook in 2004. It amplified our natural tendencies for social comparison. Here lies the first paradox  on the one hand, social media has given us unprecedented ways to stay connected with many; on the other hand, it has left many feeling more isolated than ever. As face-to-face interactions decline, social skills weaken. And online, negativity thrives. Trolling, cyberbullying and toxic exchanges fuel stress, anxiety and depression among our youths. Worse still, harmful behaviours are not only displayed, but rewarded. When such conduct gains likes, shares and attention, it creates a dangerous kind of social proof, signaling to our young that bad behaviour is normal behaviour. We also see instant gratification becoming the norm. Short-form videos and reels serve up endless distraction, curated by algorithms that create echo chambers. Many of these clips present extreme or simplistic views, yet our young spend hours \"doomscrolling\", caught in loops of distraction that they themselves call brain rot. And this is the second paradox  while diversity of thought is at our fingertips, what we consume often narrows rather than broadens our perspectives. The consequences are significant. We are seeing shorter attention spans, weaker critical thinking and reduced emotion regulation. This in turn erodes social cohesion, resilience and grit – all qualities that have defined Singapore's success. And then there is the third paradox of convenience. Technology promises to save us time – groceries at a tap, emails answered on the go. Yet, these same devices have also become relentless sources of stress. Because we can work from anywhere, we end up working everywhere. The flood of emails, WhatsApp messages and notifications deplete our mental reserves. We see a similar trade-off in healthcare. A recent study showed that doctors who leaned too heavily on AI to detect pre-cancerous growths, soon became less adept without it. This is deskilling – the quiet loss of ability when machines do too much of the work. And it mirrors daily life  the more we let technology think for us, the weaker our focus, the weaker our resilience and the weaker our grit. The lesson is clear, even as we adopt new tools, we must remember that these technologies are fundamentally just tools and we must closely guard our human strengths  judgement, intuition and compassion. Mr Speaker, Sir, our response to technology cannot be just about setting rules or guidelines. It must also be about shaping mindsets. Prime Minister has spoken about the \"we\" generation. President Tharman has called for a \"we first\" mindset – one that places the collective good above self interest. I believe this is the mindset Singapore needs as we enter our next phase of progress. A mindset is a lens through which we see the world. It shapes how we interpret events and how we respond to them. And mindsets are not born, they are shaped, by what families emphasise, what schools teach and what society chooses to reward. So, how do we nurture such a \"we first\" mindset? I believe we must start with kindness. Kindness may sound simple. But it is the foundation of empathy, resilience and perspective-taking; the very soft skills our young will need to survive in the AI era. And kindness must be lived in every sphere of life – at home, in school, in the community and in the workplace. In schools, this means teaching empathy alongside knowledge and equipping our young with stress and emotion management skills that must be practised continuously throughout their school years to be truly honed. Experiential learning – whether through community service projects or outdoor challenges, give children first-hand experience of responsibility and interdependence, and works best when reinforced with encouragement. These approaches should be built systematically into our school curriculum at every level, so that empathy and emotional resilience are not left to chance. And to make them work, we must strengthen support with more counsellors and psychologists to guide programmes and walk alongside our young as they navigate mental and emotional challenges. In families, it means modelling kindness at home, not only to strangers, but to one another. Too often, we forget to be kind to those closest to us. Children may not always listen to what we say, but they notice what we do, including our unkind behaviours and the way we use devices. Even though I worry about my kids' screen time, one day my daughter asked me, \"Why are you always on your phone?\" And that hit me – I realised that she was also modeling my behaviour. But kindness does not stop at home; it must extend into our communities. And in communities, it means designing systems that make care second nature. In Tampines East, I have seen residents care for one another in many ways. Youths teaching seniors digital skills, volunteers delivering meals to neighbours and families looking out for elderly folks living alone. These small acts of care may seem ordinary, but together they sustain the kampung spirit that defines Singapore. At the national level, we must also renew the Singapore Kindness Movement. Campaigns are useful, but lived experiences matter more. Kindness must reach into digital spaces – from gaming platforms that reward cooperation, to workplace tools that encourage us to appreciate a colleague. We should nudge, not lecture. When systems are designed so that kindness is the default – like calm rooms in shopping malls that give children with special needs and their caregivers a safe space to reset, or barrier-free ramps in our estates that make access automatic for seniors and parents; kindness becomes second nature. And by celebrating small, everyday acts of care, we show that it is not distant or heroic, but something each of us can practise daily. Finally, in business, kindness must also find its place. Businesses, too, can be a force for good. Corporate social responsibility has grown and companies today are rightly held accountable by consumers. Yet business pressures can sometimes relegate kindness to the background. We should instead support organisations that embed kindness into their DNA, whether through inclusive hiring, supporting employees who show empathy, or giving staff time and resources to serve the community. The role of Government is not to purchase kindness, but to enable it  to make it easier to care, not to pay people to care. In many parts of the world, divisions of race, religion and class are hardening. Singapore has been fortunate to avoid this, but we cannot be complacent. Numbers like the Gini coefficient show that inequality here is moderated after taxes and transfers. Yet numbers alone do not capture the lived experience of inequality. Mr Speaker, Sir, nurturing a \"we first\" mindset also means ensuring fairness, because kindness at the individual level must be matched by fairness at the structural level. A child from a lower-income family may be just as capable, but if tuition and enrichment is out of reach, he starts the race several steps behind. A worker may be diligent and talented, but if hiring unconsciously favours those who \"look the part\", it is not merit that decides, but stereotype. And when such institutional barriers combine with self-doubt or prejudice, they can quietly block opportunity. A student who keeps hearing \"people like you cannot make it\" may begin to believe it. An older worker who feels he will never be given a fair chance because of his age may stop trying. This is why we must continue to identify and dismantle barriers, both visible and invisible, so that Singapore remains a true meritocracy. A society where opportunities are not predetermined by background, but created through ability, effort and fair chance. Because only then can progress feel meaningful, not just for the successful few, but for every Singaporean who works hard and contributes. Mr Speaker, Sir, progress is not just about technology or economics. It is also about psychology. It is about ensuring that even as we advance, we do not lose sight of who we are. As we mark SG60 and look ahead to SG100 and beyond, let us remember the lessons of history. Civilisations that endured were not only those that adapted to change, but those that did so while holding fast to their values. And what are our values? The value of being human. The value of being Singaporean. Mr Speaker, in Mandarin. (In Mandarin)  In this fast-changing world, we must not forget the most fundamental values of being human. To be human is to have compassion. To be Singaporean is to share the spirit of being in the same boat, moving forward shoulder to shoulder. True progress is progress we make together. We all know how hard it is to bridge race, religion and class, and to strive together as one. But our forefathers did it and our generation will surely do it too. As long as we support one another and hold firm to our resolve, the marathon ahead is ours to win. (In English)  It is our unity, our resilience and our spirit of looking out for one another that will carry us forward. As we race to the top, let us make sure we do not leave anyone behind. Because the true test of progress is not how high we climb, but how many we bring along with us.

The Draft Master Plan 2025, developed through the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s extensive public engagement exercise, showcases our shared vision for Singapore’s land use plans and strategies for the next 10 to 15 years. We will build more homes that cater to different needs, rejuvenate older neighbourhoods and estates, and make them more liveable, vibrant and senior-friendly. Business nodes and workplaces will be revitalised, bringing jobs closer to homes. The northern, eastern, and western gateways will grow as important economic nodes, while the city centre will remain a vital destination for business, tourism and culture, anchoring Singapore’s status as a global hub. MND will keep public housing affordable and accessible, through a robust supply of Build-To-Order flats across different regions, including more with shorter waiting times. We will review the public housing income ceiling and study how to provide more housing options, including for singles, seniors and larger families. We will continue to improve public rental housing, including upgrading older rental blocks and supporting more rental households to own their homes. We will also maintain a strong supply of land for private housing. MND will enhance support for Singaporeans living in older estates, including by upgrading older towns and homes through programmes like the Home Improvement Programme and Neighbourhood Renewal Programme. We will improve infrastructure and amenities to make towns more senior-friendly. We will also develop and flesh out the framework for the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme. Selected private housing estates will also benefit from senior-friendly enhancements, under the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) (Regular Estate) and the EUP (Silver Estate). We will review legislation to ensure Management Corporations maintain and upgrade their ageing developments to meet the needs of their residents. Eligible households with seniors living in private properties will also get support to install in-home senior-friendly fittings under the Enhancement for Active Seniors (Private) programme. MND will ensure towns are well-served with recreation amenities. We will build more integrated community hubs, for example in Toa Payoh and Woodlands, bringing together sports facilities, healthcare and community spaces in one convenient location. We are expanding the network of parks and park connectors to make green spaces more accessible and planning new public spaces along Identity Corridors that anchor community activity. MND will mitigate the impact of climate change on Singaporeans through measures such as climate-sensitive urban planning and building design and the use of cool paints to mitigate the impact of rising temperatures. MND will work with industry partners to uplift the built environment (BE) sector and to offer more career opportunities for Singaporeans. We will continue to empower BE firms to embrace technologies such as artificial intelligence tools, automation and digital collaboration across the building lifecycle. MND will advance a pro-enterprise agenda, by streamlining our regulatory processes through the implementation of CORENET X and reducing regulatory burden and business costs. MND will work with industry partners to catalyse new growth opportunities. This includes empowering commercial property owners to undertake place management through the Business Improvement District initiative and partnering local companies to develop innovative products and solutions, which can benefit the BE sector in Singapore and abroad. Together with all Singaporeans, MND will shape a vibrant and sustainable future for our city – one that every generation can take pride in calling home."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

Under the current ABA, the maximum penalty for a cruelty offence is higher than that for a welfare offence. Repeat offenders are also liable for enhanced punishment. Where acts of cruelty are particularly aggravated, the prosecution will highlight this to the Courts to take into account for sentencing. National Parks Board (NParks) has started a comprehensive review to ensure ABA remains effective in deterring acts of animal cruelty and abuse. This includes reviewing the penalty framework, such as imprisonment terms, fines and disqualification orders, for animal welfare offences and enforcement powers for better animal welfare and management. The review currently does not include proposals to prevent the posting of animal abuse content online or increase collaboration on enforcement with animal welfare groups. To reduce disamenities caused by irresponsible pet ownership, NParks has launched initiatives, such as cat licensing, under the Cat Management Framework and the pet ownership course. We will continue to take a collaborative approach in this review. For instance, Minister of State Alvin Tan had engaged Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) and Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) in July on their White Paper on Strengthening Protections for Animal Welfare. We agreed that while some recommendations will be challenging to implement due to the trade-offs, we could adopt some recommendations as part of the ABA review and further evaluate others with partners. NParks will continue to engage stakeholders, such as animal welfare groups, pet business owners and vets, to ensure that all views are considered. NParks aims to start public consultation on the draft Bill by around end-2026. NParks will continue to investigate feedback on animal welfare and cruelty thoroughly. For instance, in the recent cases involving community cats in Yishun and Punggol, NParks interviewed key witnesses, reviewed CCTV footage and carried out post-mortem examination for the Yishun community cat and found that the cases were likely the result of vehicular accidents. NParks will take firm enforcement action, considering factors, such as severity of the offence and whether it is a repeat offender. In line with its enforcement efforts, NParks also works with animal welfare group partners to increase education and outreach efforts to raise awareness of responsible pet ownership and the consequences of animal cruelty."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

National Parks Board (NParks) takes a proactive, holistic and science-based approach to manage the pigeon population across Singapore. These include direct population control, with trapping and removal, habitat modification, enforcement against illegal bird-feeding and education and outreach efforts to reduce human-generated food sources. Since July 2024, NParks has partnered Town Councils, the National Environment Agency and Singapore Food Agency to step up these efforts in hotspots under the pigeon management pilot. The pilot showed encouraging results. There has been a decrease in the estimated pigeon population by around 50% across the three town councils, namely Ang Mo Kio, Bishan Toa-Payoh and Tanjong Pagar. The pigeon-related feedback is around 34% lower than the average. These results were derived by comparing against control areas that were not part of the pilot. In June 2025, NParks expanded the pigeon management plan to three more hotspot town councils, namely Jalan Besar, Marsiling-Yew Tee and Nee Soon. NParks will scale this up across Singapore in phases to help manage the pigeon population. Specific to the Housing and Development Board (HDB) estates, NParks and HDB have been studying pigeon-related issues and will continue to monitor feedback from residents and trial deterrent measures, such as bird nettings, in consultation with town councils. There are currently no plans to modify the Home Improvement Programme to address this issue. Keeping the pigeon population under control requires a collective community effort.

HDB acceded to about one in four appeals, mainly for households in financial difficulties or extenuating circumstances, who have no alternative housing options.

Under the current ABA, the maximum penalty for a cruelty offence is higher than that for a welfare offence. Repeat offenders are also liable for enhanced punishment. Where acts of cruelty are particularly aggravated, the prosecution will highlight this to the Courts to take into account for sentencing. The National Parks Board (NParks) has started a comprehensive review to ensure the ABA remains effective in deterring acts of animal cruelty and abuse. This includes reviewing the penalty framework, such as imprisonment terms, fines and disqualification orders for animal welfare offences, and enforcement powers for better animal welfare and management. The review currently does not include proposals to prevent the posting of animal abuse content online or increase collaboration on enforcement with animal welfare groups. To reduce disamenities caused by irresponsible pet ownership, NParks has launched initiatives, such as cat licensing under the Cat Management Framework and the Pet Ownership Course. We will continue to take a collaborative approach in this review. For instance, Minister of State Alvin Tan had engaged the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in July on their White Paper on Strengthening Protections for Animal Welfare. We agreed that while some recommendations will be challenging to implement due to the tradeoffs, we could adopt some recommendations as part of the ABA review and further evaluate others with partners. NParks will continue to engage stakeholders, such as animal welfare groups, pet business owners and vets to ensure that all views are considered. NParks aims to start public consultation on the draft Bill by around end-2026. NParks will continue to investigate feedback on animal welfare and cruelty thoroughly. For instance, in the recent cases involving community cats in Yishun and Punggol, NParks interviewed key witnesses, reviewed closed-circuit television footage, and carried out post-mortem examination for the Yishun community cat, and found that the cases were likely the result of vehicular accidents. NParks will take firm enforcement action, considering factors such as severity of the offence and whether one is a repeat offender. In line with its enforcement efforts, NParks also works with animal welfare group partners to increase education and outreach efforts to raise awareness of responsible pet ownership and the consequences of animal cruelty."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

Vacancy rates for commercial properties have remained stable over the past three years at around 7% for retail spaces and around 11% for office spaces, comparable to pre-COVID-19 levels. Landlords are unlikely to leave their properties vacant for too long, as prolonged vacancy could affect property valuation and limit capital appreciation. It is also not financially sustainable for the landlord to incur holding costs, such as property tax and mortgage repayments, as well as opportunity costs from foregone rental income. Given these considerations, we do not see a need to impose a vacancy tax on commercial properties. We acknowledge concerns from some retail and food and beverage business owners that their business costs, including rents, have risen. At an aggregate level, rent increases of private retail spaces have trended below the inflation rate in the past three years. At a local level, there will invariably be differences in the rents, with some commercial properties commanding higher rents due to their more attractive attributes, such as shopping malls integrated with mass rapid transit stations. For more cost-conscious businesses, a variety of lower-cost options remain available. The Urban Redevelopment Authority publishes detailed rental data every quarter, which offers the public and businesses sufficient insights to make well-informed leasing or investment decisions."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

Under the current ABA, the maximum penalty for a cruelty offence is higher than that for a welfare offence. Repeat offenders are also liable for enhanced punishment. Where acts of cruelty are particularly aggravated, the prosecution will highlight this to the Courts to take into account for sentencing. The National Parks Board (NParks) has started a comprehensive review to ensure ABA remains effective in deterring acts of animal cruelty and abuse. This includes reviewing the penalty framework, such as imprisonment terms, fines and disqualification orders for animal welfare offences, and enforcement powers for better animal welfare and management. The review currently does not include proposals to prevent the posting of animal abuse content online or increase collaboration on enforcement with animal welfare groups. To reduce disamenities caused by irresponsible pet ownership, NParks has launched initiatives, such as cat licensing under the Cat Management Framework and the Pet Ownership Course. We will continue to take a collaborative approach in this review. For instance, Minister of State Alvin Tan had engaged Animal Concerns Research and Education Society and Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in July on their White Paper on Strengthening Protections for Animal Welfare. We agreed that while some recommendations will be challenging to implement due to the trade-offs, we could adopt some recommendations as part of the ABA review and further evaluate others with partners. NParks will continue to engage stakeholders, such as animal welfare groups, pet business owners and vets, to ensure that all views are considered. NParks aims to start public consultation on the draft Bill by around end-2026. NParks will continue to investigate feedback on animal welfare and cruelty thoroughly. For instance, in the recent cases involving community cats in Yishun and Punggol, NParks interviewed key witnesses, reviewed closed-circuit television footage and carried out post-mortem examination for the Yishun community cat, and found that the cases were likely the result of vehicular accidents. NParks will take firm enforcement action, considering factors, such as severity of the offence, and whether it is a repeat offender. In line with its enforcement efforts, NParks also works with animal welfare group partners to increase education and outreach efforts to raise awareness of responsible pet ownership and the consequences of animal cruelty."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

My reply will also address a related question by Mr Andre Low for written answer on 24 September. Starting from the late 2030s, we will begin to see more HDB flats reach the 70-year mark of their 99-year leases. The Ministry of National Development (MND) and the Housing and Development Board (HDB) will adopt a multi-pronged approach to keep our older flats and estates liveable and vibrant. First, we will upgrade the ageing flats to ensure their safety and liveability. These older flats would have already benefited from one round of upgrades under the previous Main Upgrading Programme (MUP) or the current Home Improvement Programme (HIP) for flats that have passed the 30-year mark. We plan to introduce a second round of upgrades via HIP II for flats which pass the 60-year mark. HIP II will ensure that our older flats are able to last the flat owners till the end of their 99-year lease. Besides the flats, HDB will also upgrade our older estates and neighbourhoods through programmes such as the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) and the Silver Upgrading Programme (SUP). We will ensure that residents who are staying in older estates can continue to enjoy a vibrant neighbourhood with refreshed facilities and greenery. Complementing these efforts is the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS). The primary purpose of VERS is to facilitate the orderly redevelopment of ageing estates by spacing out the redevelopment and construction works in towns where there are many older blocks that were built around the same time. As I had explained in an earlier media interview, VERS is a complex policy and a long-term undertaking for our society. It will impact existing flat owners and future generations of Singaporeans. So, the policy must be designed carefully to be fair and sustainable for both groups. We aim to firm up as many of the policy details as possible during this term of Government. After we have established the VERS framework and parameters, we can then start with a few selected sites, likely in the first half of the next decade. We will continually review our processes as we go along and progressively scale up the VERS programme by the late 2030s, when more HDB flats reach their 70-year mark. Sir, while the details of the scheme are still being firmed up, I would like to highlight three key considerations which I hope we can have broad agreement on from both sides of the House. First, in managing ageing flats and estates, our first priority is to ensure that Singaporeans have a home for life. Today, about 2.5% of HDB households do not own flats that cover the owners to at least age 95. So, 2.5%. The current median lifespan of Singaporeans is 84. Hence, almost all our HDB households own flats with leases that can cover the owners for life. We will continue to closely monitor the proportion of HDB households who do not own flats with sufficient duration of leases that can cover the owners to the end of life and keep this number as small as possible. Second, as I mentioned earlier, the primary purpose of VERS is to facilitate the orderly redevelopment of towns where many older flats were built within short periods of time. This will allow redevelopment works to be carried out in phases within such towns, which will be less disruptive to residents and heartland businesses. Based on this approach, it is not necessary for every older flat to go through VERS, as we are mindful of the disruption to our residents who will need to relocate when their flats undergo VERS. In addition, VERS, as the \"V\" suggests, is voluntary. So, there could be instances where residents who are offered VERS, collectively decide not to proceed. For residents who do not go through VERS, they can continue to stay in their flats until the leases run out. The Government will support them in other ways to keep their flats and estates liveable and vibrant, including through upgrading programs like HIP II, SUP and NRP, which I spoke about earlier. This area of work is an important part of our review as we want to look after residents who go through VERS and also those who do not go through VERS. Third, HDB flats are sold with 99-year leases. A leasehold system ensures fairness to future generations. After 99 years, the land is returned to the state and we can recycle it to build new homes for future generations. This approach allows our current generation to enjoy a diverse range of affordable and accessible housing, while also taking care of the needs of future generations. It improves inter-generational mobility and prevents our society from being split into property owners and those who are not. Mr Low asked how the VERS package would differ from the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) package. We had explained previously that VERS and SERS have different objectives. SERS is for selected precincts with high redevelopment potential, unlocked through compulsory acquisition. In contrast, VERS is also to spread out, space out the redevelopment of older towns over time and it will be voluntary in nature. Flats offered VERS will have shorter remaining leases compared to the flats which were previously offered SERS, so the overall compensation for VERS would be lower compared to SERS. Based on the questions from Mr Foo and Mr Low, I note that there is broad agreement from both sides of the House that VERS should not create a lottery effect or end up becoming a wealth-generating programme. I agree with these views from both Members. MND is working out the details of the compensation package. Just as how the valuation of flats varies today, the compensation amount would similarly vary across different VERS sites and flats. We are also studying details such as the voting process and how to support the various demographic groups across different VERS sites with relocation options. MND and HDB will engage Singaporeans on the framework and policy parameters when we are ready with the draft proposals to take in further views and feedback before we finalise the policy and implementation details."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

I thank him for that. Mr Low has also raised some very valid questions in terms of how we are going to carry out the VERS policy. These are indeed some of the key considerations that my colleagues and I are currently discussing. I agree with Mr Low that the large majority of the flat owners for the flats that are going through VERS, would likely be seniors. If we can maintain the gatekeeping for people to buy homes that can last them for life, so by the time the flats reach the time that they need to go through VERS, which will be at least about 70 years or more, we would expect that most of the residents staying in these older flats would be seniors and hopefully, they would have already paid off their mortgages. So, that is why we feel that it is important to have that upfront gatekeeping, to ensure that when people buy homes, we keep the number of people who cannot stay in these homes till the end of their lives to be as small as possible, so that homes can be for life. I also agree with Mr Low that the voting process needs to be looked at carefully. Because the stakes are higher, as Mr Low pointed out, compared to say, going through HIP. So, certainly I think we would have to pay careful attention to how we manage the voting process to ensure fairness to different stakeholders. Whether we do it at the estate level or at the block level, I think these are important issues that we need to look at. I do not want to jump too far ahead, so I do seek Mr Low's understanding that these are details which I think we would have to share after we have carefully considered the different options. But if you think back on the objectives of VERS, which is to facilitate the orderly redevelopment of older towns where there are many flats that were built around the same period, I think you do need to implement some of this redevelopment, not block by block, but at least a cluster of a few blocks, so that it will be a more orderly process for the redevelopment works."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

Indeed, I think this consideration between how we can help residents who go through VERS and how we can also look after residents who do not go through VERS, is an important one. I would say that while we are firming up the policy parameters and the details of VERS, it should not stop us from being clear. Because there will be residents who do not go through VERS – either because they are not offered VERS or because they voted not to proceed with VERS collectively – that we will have to make sure that their flats and their estates can remain liveable, can remain safe and can remain vibrant. This is something which we will have to pay careful attention to. We will share more details of HIP II when we are ready. But the concept of HIP II is, say, at the 60-year and above mark, to be able to invest in upgrading the interiors of the older flats to keep them safe and liveable and to also pay attention to looking after the needs of the residents as they age together with the flats. So, the upgrades will also have to pay attention to making the flats senior-friendly and safe. That is something which, I think, we are quite clear. That regardless of what the package for VERS is, this objective of upgrading our older flats to keep them liveable, safe, upgrade our estates to keep our estates vibrant and liveable; that is something that we will do. On top of that, there will be a need to think through the parameters of VERS. Because Mr Foo is correct that if we do not have anyone voting for VERS, supporting VERS, going through with VERS, then we cannot achieve the objective of orderly redevelopment. So, that is something we will have to think through and strike a careful balance on, so that we are fair to both the existing flat owners, but also to future generations and to keep this sustainable."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

Beyond collaborations with research institutions, HDB also conducts Post-Occupancy Surveys for all newly completed Build-To-Order developments, as well as focus group discussions and observational studies.

In addition, commercial vehicles tend to be physically larger and protrude from car lots, obstruct the view of other car park users and block passengers in vehicles next to theirs from opening their doors. Commercial vehicles exceeding the weight limit may apply to HDB to park at HDB surface residential car parks, and HDB will consider this on a case-by-case basis. They can also park at commercial and industrial car parks, as well as purpose-built heavy vehicle parks. We note the increasing prevalence of electric commercial vehicles, which are heavier because of their batteries. The agencies are doing a review on how the structure of our carparks can be enhanced to allow such vehicles."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

Indeed, we do want to encourage more families to stay near their family members, whether parents or children, so that the family can provide mutual support to one another. HDB offers a range of priority schemes to enhance the ballot chances of certain groups. Please allow me to just share a little bit with the House. For example, all first-timers receive one additional ballot. First-timer parents and married couples, eligible families receive an additional ballot. In other words, three ballots in total if they apply for a 4-room or a smaller standard flat. The first-timer families who have been unsuccessful in two or more BTO applications for standard 4-room smaller flats will receive an additional ballot chance for each subsequent BTO application for a standard flat. So, we do want to help them if they continue to apply for a standard flat, 4-room or smaller, to keep increasing their chances if they are unsuccessful. On top of this, we give priority also under various schemes to further enhance chances of various groups. Of our available BTO flat supply, we set aside 40% for the Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme (FPPS) and 30% for the FCS (Proximity) that I just shared in my main reply. And the purpose is to support young parents and those who wish to live near their parents. Those who qualify for both schemes would be balloted twice. If you qualify for both, first, you ballot under FPPS and if you are not successful, then you have another go under FCS (Proximity). Those who are unsuccessful in both ballots are then balloted again as a first-time, public applicant. So, we offer higher chances to certain groups of buyers but to be candid, balloting outcomes cannot be guaranteed because there is an element of luck. This is especially so in popular projects, like the one that Ms Tan mentioned, and also in the larger flats such as 5-room flats or SBF flats, which the supply is smaller but the demand is high. To improve the chances of more people being able to get the flat, we are building more flats. We are trying to launch more. We just announced the October launch, more than 9,000 flats, in total, including Shorter Waiting Time flats. And we want to encourage applicants to also consider applying for projects where there are larger supplies because the application rate would then be better. During the application process, the application rates by estate and flat type would also be provided online and updated multiple times a day.

My guidance to my colleagues in the Ministry of National Development and HDB is to build more and build faster so that we can keep up a robust supply of new HDB flats. Sir, it is in the interest of contractors to complete projects ahead of schedule if they can because this allows them to recover and reinvest their capital more quickly. It also helps with the re-allocation of resources across projects that the contractors are undertaking. So, HDB will indeed continue to work closely with the agencies and the contractors to expedite the approvals and to support timely project completion. We bring forward development where feasible to deliver more Shorter Waiting Time flats to Singaporeans. We have increased the supply of such flats from 2,800 last year to 4,690 this year – which exceeded our commitment of 4,500 – and we will continue to build more of such Shorter Waiting Time flats. However, there are sites with longer development timelines because they may include sites that require more complex preparatory works which then limit how early we can start and we will continue to look at how we can optimise the timelines while ensuring a steady quality supply of homes. Sir, we also recognise that longer waiting times can affect home buyers including those who are looking to start a family, those who have children. So, to help them, to support them HDB offers Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) which provides a temporary housing option for eligible families while they wait for their BTO flats. HDB has been ramping the supply of PPHS flats from 800 in 2021 to about 4,000 by the end of this year. As a result, the application rate has come down significantly and since June 2023, all eligible applicants who are married with a child aged 18 and below, including expectant parents, have been invited to select a PPHS flat.

With the ER-CDR, residents no longer need to lift heavy laundry loads on bamboo poles out of their windows and slot them into narrow pipe sockets. This is particularly beneficial for seniors and is increasingly important with our ageing population. Furthermore, as the installation of ER-CDR involves adding an external fixture to HDB flats, it is better for HDB to carry out the works across the board in one exercise. Therefore, the ER-CDR is an essential rather than optional component. Essential improvements under the HIP are fully funded by the Government for Singapore Citizen households. HDB has actively engaged residents undergoing HIP to explain the benefits of the ER-CDR, conducted demonstrations on its proper usage and gathered user feedback. In response to residents' feedback, HDB has made several improvements to the ER-CDR design, including increasing laundry capacity and improving ergonomics of the pole. HDB has also uploaded an instructional video on YouTube to provide residents with a step-by-step guide on using the rack, tips to maximise laundry capacity and advice on how to quickly collect laundry when it rains. Recent surveys conducted at selected completed HIP precincts showed that over 80% of residents considered the ER-CDR safe, while close to 70% found it easy to use. Some residents noted that they needed time to adjust to this new method of drying laundry.

Singapore upholds high regulatory standards in our financial system aligned with international standards. It is one reason why many investors view Singapore as a trusted financial hub. Like other global financial centres, having high standards does not mean there will be zero cases involving entities and individuals who break the rules or who fail to comply with our regulatory requirements. What is key is that where wrongdoing is identified, the authorities will investigate thoroughly and take firm enforcement action in accordance with the law. The money laundering investigations by the Police against Chen Zhi and related associates are ongoing. Enforcement operations were conducted on 30 October 2025. Arising from the enforcement operations, the Police have issued prohibition of disposal orders and seized a range of assets, including properties, cars, bank accounts and securities accounts. Prior to the indictment of Chen Zhi by the United States (US), our Police had been conducting probes into Chen Zhi and his associates. Thus far, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has identified two Single Family Offices (SFO) funds granted tax incentives that are linked to the sanctioned individuals. MAS has ceased the tax incentives. As investigations are ongoing, I seek Members’ understanding that I am not able to comment further on the details at this stage.

Besides the rejected applications, some potential applicants also withdrew their interest to apply before submitting a formal application when questions were posed and requirements were clarified at the pre-application stage. As part of the tax incentive application process, individuals and entities are screened against databases to check that there are no reports on their involvement in illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing. The SFO fund is also required to open and maintain an account with an MAS-licensed bank and be subject to the bank’s customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring checks, including detecting any unusual or suspicious transactions. MAS regularly reviews and refines its regulatory regime. It consulted on proposed changes to the SFO regulatory regime in July 2023. In addition to now requiring all SFOs based in Singapore, whether they are receiving tax incentives or not, to maintain bank accounts, SFOs will need to notify MAS upon the commencement of their operations and submit annual returns to MAS. The returns supplement MAS’ ongoing surveillance efforts to maintain the integrity of our financial system. MAS and the financial industry will continue to review our surveillance and detection capabilities. But we need to adopt a sensible and calibrated approach, and should refrain from a knee-jerk overreaction when cases happen from time to time. Similar to all major international financial centres, it is not possible to have zero incidents given the complex nature of the financial services industry and the high volume of daily transactions. In addition, combatting financial crime requires a global effort, as illicit fund flows are often cross-border in nature. In the Prince Holdings case, the US seized US$15 billion in Bitcoins and the United Kingdom (UK) froze 19 properties. It was announced yesterday that Hong Kong and Taiwan have also recently moved to seize substantial amounts of assets and have made arrests. All major financial centres have to remain vigilant and work together to combat financial crimes. Sir, SFOs linked to individuals convicted of money laundering offences represent a very small proportion of the overall sector, at less than 1%. We have to remain open to bona fide family offices and genuine investors, to continue growing our financial services industry and creating good jobs for our people. As at end 2024, the wealth management and private banking functions in banks employed more than 13,000 locals. High net worth clients also use other service providers such as legal and tax advisors, fund administrators and accounting firms. Compared to other financial centres, many industry stakeholders already consider Singapore to have more stringent due diligence standards for high net worth clients. If we were to tighten further to the point where the processes become overly cumbersome, it will affect our competitiveness, deter legitimate investors and put many local jobs at risk. This is not the outcome we want for Singapore. There is a Chinese saying that when we open the windows, some flies may also enter. The solution is not to shut our windows and block out sunlight and fresh air. What matters is that we act swiftly to deal with the flies that enter, while also letting in sunlight and fresh air. This is the approach we take in Singapore. Risk-proportionate, not zero-risk. MAS will continue to take a risk-proportionate approach to maintain our status as a trusted financial centre. MAS expects our financial institutions to do the same, so that we collectively maintain high standards while keeping our system efficient and competitive. Singapore will also continue to work closely with our international counterparts to deter and enforce against bad actors who operate across different jurisdictions."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

I only wanted to clarify the position so that I can give him a considered response. Earlier, some of his other colleagues, including Mr Pritam Singh, Leader of the Opposition, said that the WP will be a responsible opposition party. And I hope Mr Tiong bears that in mind in our future discourse. Sir, I thank the WP's Mr Tiong for agreeing with me that we should not adopt a zero-risk approach. I think that is the key point that I wanted to clarify. So, he could have just said that and not add on all the other additional comments. So, if we agree with that, that it is not practical to adopt a zero-risk approach, then I think we can take a look at what are some of the moves that we can make to maintain high standards on one hand, that is important, we want to remain a trusted financial centre; and at the same time, remain efficient and competitive. Having high standards is not at odds with being efficient and competitive. If Mr Tiong believes that being inefficient, being overly cumbersome, adopting a zero-risk approach, being overly risk adverse, is the right way to go, I think if we follow his advice, our financial hub status is at risk. We need to take a risk-proportionate, calibrated approach, just like all other major international financial centres – maintain high standards, deter bad actors, take action against them when we discover wrongdoings. No doubt about that. That is our position. But at the same time, welcome genuine investors, legitimate family offices who want to set up and tap our financial services industry here, and create jobs for our people. That is the approach that Singapore wants to take. With regard to the first supplementary question from Mr Tiong, the reports that have surfaced, I mentioned in my main reply that the banks have also been taking action in monitoring the situation and we do reject some of the applications, and some of them, they withdrew after the banks asked questions. And there is also a system whereby the financial institutions would file Suspicious Transactions Reports (STRs). This was something that the banks, the financial institutions have been doing earlier. But we need to bear in mind that STRs on their own do not equate to offences being committed. It is just a suspicious transaction that is being highlighted. For the Police, the Police would have to take a look at these early signals, including the STRs that are filed, and conduct further enquiries on their own, including looking at financial intelligence that they have picked up. And this is what the Police had done. They had also worked with their foreign counterparts to gather further information on the case, because, as I mentioned in my main reply, this case involves not just Singapore, but many other jurisdictions. And after the news broke in October 2025, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) reached out to international counterparts to gather more information on criminality with nexus to Singapore to further these investigations and then took action on 30 October, as I mentioned in my main reply. Mr Tiong also asked, I think he made a comment that there are many flies in the house. I do not know which \"house\" Mr Tiong is referring to, but as far as we are aware, the house of Singapore, we do not have many flies. I mentioned earlier that the SFOs that are involved in money laundering and are convicted for money laundering, represent less than 1%. So, if we accept that we do not want to have zero risk, and we accept that when we open the windows to let in sunlight and fresh air, that there will be some flies, I think less than 1% to me, does not mean that there are many, many flies in this house. And I also mentioned that when we detect those flies, we deal with them firmly. I think that is the key. Not to aim for zero, not to go for zero risk. But when we detect any cases of wrongdoing, when we detect any flies, we go for them. We take a firm enforcement approach. MAS will continue to review our rules and our procedures. I think Mr Tiong is mistaken that we only do the checks at the point of application and not on an ongoing basis. I mentioned earlier that the banks do file STRs, and we are also in the process of reviewing what our rules should be, so that we are able to maintain high standards, we are able to deter bad actors from wanting to come to Singapore and importantly, maintain our competitiveness as a financial centre."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

In the announcement that I made earlier this year, I made it clear – and this is in the public domain, on public record – that we want to look at how we can streamline some of the processes so that the waiting time is not too long, but at the same time, I emphasised this, we must maintain high standards. Why? Because Singapore is not competing on the basis of being the quickest, the one with the lowest standards, the easiest to set up an account. That is not our competitive advantage. Our competitive advantage is that we are a trusted financial centre. And if we want to achieve that, we need to maintain high standards. So, that is why I emphasised that any process change and any streamlining should not compromise our high standards. Having said that, the process changes that we are looking at are also not at odds with maintaining high standards. So, I want to assure Ms Lim that it is not to ask the financial institutions to skip steps or to not look out for certain suspicious reports in their due diligence checks. I think we must maintain high standards in that area. But it is really to clarify – so, what are we looking for, to avoid a lot of toing and froing, and second guessing? And it is also to look at how we can streamline the processes so that, through the use of technology, through the use of information sharing, we make it more efficient, so that we do not deter the genuine cases, but we block out and we do not admit the ones that are suspicious and have problems that will affect our high standards and reputation. It is a fine calibration, but I want to assure Ms Lim that what we recently announced is meant to simplify the requirements and improve operational efficiency. It does not change the anti-money laundering checks that we submit the applicants to. They are still screened, they are still checked.  They will continue to be required to open and maintain a bank account in Singapore, which means that the account will continue to be subject to the bank's customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring checks. That was my clarification with Mr Tiong earlier. It is not just at the point of application. It is ongoing check as well. So, this is something which I hope the WP, if you agree that we should not adopt a zero-risk approach, but a risk-proportional approach, then I think we need to strike that balance. We do want our financial services industry to remain competitive, our wealth management industry to remain competitive. I mentioned in my main reply that this sector supports at least 13,000 local jobs and may grow further.

This was before the US made public that they are taking action against Chen Zhi and his associates.

I think Mr Chua is familiar with how this works. He is from the financial services industry. STRs on their own may not equate to an offence being committed. It is just to highlight that could be what looks like a suspicious transaction.

As we all know, the Government has long held that directing GIC to invest in locally listed firms is not the solution to improve the attractiveness of the local equity market, and its mandate specifically includes the Singapore market. This is unlike Malaysia's Employees' Provident Fund, EPF, which is the largest investor in its domestic market, supporting Malaysian companies, capital needs and the economy as a whole”. Unquote. Sir, I had that impression about the remarks that Mr Chua made. But after hearing what Mr Tiong clarified earlier, that the Workers' Party is also of the same view that we should not be pump-priming the market by asking GIC and Temasek, to mandate them to invest in local equities, then, I think we are on the same page.

I rise in support of the Motion of Thanks for the President's address. It is a privilege for me to join this debate as a new Member. First, I would like to thank the residents of Tengah and Chua Chu Kang for giving me the opportunity to speak in the 15th Parliament. I am also immensely grateful to my better half and my two-year-old for their unwavering love. And to my team and volunteers, thank you for being my second family. Last week, I watched my two-year-old play with gears, and it reminded me of how healthcare and research are like the hidden gears behind a masterfully crafted clock. You do not always see them, but they keep life moving – quietly, precisely, relentlessly. Each gear must be aligned; each spring must be wound with care. If even one falters, a missed diagnosis, a delayed study, the whole system stutters. Today, I would like to speak on two areas that are deeply intertwined with our future  healthcare and research. First, on healthcare. Singapore's healthcare conversation is evolving. It is no longer solely about life and death. It is about how we live in old age and in sickness, and the quality of life we can sustain across the lifespan. This shift in focus brings urgency to how we manage downstream healthcare, supporting those already living with illness, especially within our growing population of older citizens. Strategic, long-term planning is essential. Judicious allocation of resources will determine whether our healthcare standards remain sustainable and continue to improve. Importantly, downstream care is not just about ageing. It encompasses a broader spectrum of lived experiences  the young adult recovering from a stroke; the parent managing a child’s autism diagnosis; the worker coping with chronic pain; the caregiver supporting both ageing parents and young children. To meet these diverse and increasing demands while upholding healthcare quality, we need to continually review how care is delivered. One area is manpower efficiency. Perhaps we can draw on current nurse-led models under Healthier SG and expand the autonomy of Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) in referrals and prescriptions. This is already standard in countries like the UK. Outside hospitals and within our communities, engaging seniors meaningfully can be key to optimising their physical and mental health. Rather than seeing seniors as passive recipients of care, we should recognise senior volunteerism as a strategic asset. Regardless of age, mobility, or technology proficiency; whether they use a wheelchair, a tongkat, or none at all – we can all actively welcome seniors into care initiatives through volunteer networks. This unlocks a win-win  seniors gain purpose and connection, while communities benefit from their care and experience. Yet, to truly future-proof our healthcare system, we must look upstream, well before illness sets in. Healthier SG has laid a strong foundation. We can build on this momentum by focusing on the first 1,000 days of life, perhaps through initiatives like Grow Well SG that centres on child well-being. To enhance its impact, I suggest  moving beyond reactive screening by offering guidance on postural health and ergonomics from early school-going age; embedding early touchpoints into antenatal care to equip first-time parents with tools for building healthy routines from the start; redesigning existing spaces in HDB estates to include multi-use play corners that encourage outdoor activity, family bonding and intergenerational engagement. Besides care recipients, caregivers are an integral part of the healthcare landscape. Singapore has laid the groundwork for caregiving support through subsidies, respite services and community programmes. But the caregiving landscape is evolving and we must elevate our approach. Caregiving is complex. It is not one role, but many – nurse, planner, advocate, emotional anchor. Support must go beyond financial aid. To truly elevate support, we should involve caregiving-trained professionals in policy, programme design and decision-making; and individuals who understand care from the inside out. More spending does not guarantee better outcomes. If done right, caregiving support should be precise, efficient and impactful. To better support caregivers, I propose  expanding flexible work arrangements and caregiving leave to accommodate diverse caregiving needs, starting with the public sector and extending through legislation to the private sector; supporting caregivers in regular health screenings, by integrating them into existing national programmes such as Healthier SG Screening; and incorporating mental health screening for caregivers, leveraging on existing screening providers. Let me now move on to research. I will begin with research strategy, followed by research impact assessment. Singapore committed $28 billion under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 Plan. But investment alone is not vision. We must ask  what are we building and who are we becoming? We cannot simply cruise along with the flow of the waters; we need to accelerate and ride with the waves – as the Chinese saying goes, \"不随波逐流，要乘风破浪\". In a world of rapid innovation, drifting with the current may seem safe, but it leaves us vulnerable to external tides. If we only follow, we risk becoming dependent on others for the technologies and solutions that shape our future. So, we must define our own direction. We are not striving to be sellers of everything, but we cannot afford to be buyers of everything either. Take the current trend of AI as an example. Instead of focusing only on applications built elsewhere, we must ask, \"Can we Singapore lead in artificial intelligence on novel applications, such as, for multilingual societies, for small data environments, or for public trust and governance?\" And beyond trends, what is Singapore's own version of artificial intelligence? I appeal to the Government to define and commit to long-term strategic research domains, fields where Singapore can lead – invest in Singapore-branded technologies that enhance national resilience in essential sectors; encourage and enable researchers to pursue high-risk, long-horizon questions through targeted grants; and infrastructure support and collaboration platforms. When policy and innovation move together with clarity and courage, Singapore will not only keep pace with the waves of innovation. We will set our own direction, chart a course others can follow and build capabilities that serve our people and economy for decades to come. And finally, on research expenditure and impact assessment. We have committed billions to support research, innovation and enterprise. But the question is not how much we spend; it is what we get from what we spend. We must ensure that funding is not merely meeting check-box criteria, but delivering real impact. Are we solving the problems we set out to solve? Are we plugging the gaps that matter most? We often measure success by volume; papers published, grants awarded, partnerships signed. These are important, but they do not always reflect whether the work is transformative or relevant. We must also be mindful of the administrative workload on researchers. When too much time is spent on compliance and reporting, we risk shifting focus away from innovation. Accountability is essential, but it must be proportionate and purposeful. And we need research-trained professionals, not just those with degrees, but those with deep, discipline-based expertise to manage and evaluate research outcomes. To ensure that every dollar spent delivers maximum value, I propose the following  support early-career scientists with targeted funding that promotes exploration, innovation and breakthrough thinking; shift to impact-driven evaluation by requiring grant programmes to define success upfront in terms of national outcomes, with clear plans for industry partnerships or public sector applications; streamline grant processes – consolidate duplicative calls across agencies and reduce excessive reporting requirements to allow researchers to focus on innovation; ensure funding decisions and outcome assessments are guided by domain experts with deep research expertise and relevant field experience. Mr Speaker, Sir, \"我们要把钱花在刀刃上\", means spending money where it matters most. Let us continue to invest boldly but, also wisely, that our research efforts deliver not just quantity and activity, but authentic, measurable impact. Today, I spoke on healthcare and research. But there is much more to speak on, and beneath these diverse topics, lies a common thread. Let me offer an analogy  Singapore is like a boat. We are all in it together, each with different personalities, backgrounds and perspectives. There is no right or wrong in who we are. What matters is that we row in the same direction. In healthcare, in research, in every policy we shape, we must choose the right way, not the easy way. The right way demands courage, clarity and compassion. It asks us to listen deeply, act boldly and build patiently. And let me end with this reflection. This is inspired by the Prime Minister's National Day Rally speech and the President's Parliamentary address. Mr Speaker, in Mandarin. (In Mandarin)  We are not passengers — we are crew. Each with a different rhythm, a different strength. But the boat moves only when we row together. Not in circles. Not apart. Forward. Let us choose the right way, not the easy way. Let us move as many, but sail as one."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

CareShield Life will play an increasingly vital role in our social safety net as we join the ranks of super aged societies. As a cornerstone of our national insurance framework, its financial support ensures that Singaporeans and Permanent Residents with severe disability and who require long-term care will have the funds to meet their care needs. I support the review and recommendations of the CareShield Life Council, which have been timely and necessary. Its stance is balanced, weighing the need for sufficient payouts for essential care against affordable premiums. To be sustainable in the long term, higher payouts have to be backed by corresponding premium increase rates. Hence, the Government's transitional support for policyholders in the form of premium subsidies, is welcomed. After this five-year financial support ends, how would the Government ensure that the premiums remain affordable? Would the MOH consider premium discounts for policyholders who lead healthier lifestyles, such as abstention from smoking? I welcome the Government's decision to improve and simplify the claims process and streamline applications across all national care schemes which the claimants are eligible for, as recommended by the Council. One of the Council's recommendations being considered by MOH is tele-assessments for claimants, in addition to those performed at their own residences, public hospitals and the assessors' places of practice, such as clinics. When does the Ministry expect to conclude its feasibility study on this? How will the assessors guard against fraud and potential misdiagnoses for tele-assessments? Assessors play a pivotal role in the CareShield Life scheme, serving as the gatekeepers who determine eligibility for payouts based on an individual's ability to perform ADLs. Their assessments directly impact the timeliness and fairness of financial support for those in severe disability, making their expertise and judgment essential to the integrity of the system. As we seek to improve the claims process and make it more claimant-friendly, it is timely to ask  what qualifications and training are required to become an assessor and how are we ensuring that there are enough assessors to meet growing demand? As of 2024, there were 1,821 active claimants under CareShield Life. The age of the claimants ranged from 30 to 93, with about half of them in their 30s and 40s. Would MOH provide a breakdown of the claimants by age groups of 10, for example, starting from age 30 to 40, 40 to 50 and so on; and by types of major causes, such as strokes, hereditary diseases and so on? With these information, would it be possible to implement preventive measures to reduce the number of cases in each age and vulnerability group? In addition, would the Ministry share how many cases of appeal it had received in each of the years since CareShield Life started? What were the percentages of successful and unsuccessful appeal cases? What were the lessons learnt from these appeals and how has the Ministry improved on its assessment process? Mr Speaker, these changes demonstrate our commitment to make CareShield Life financially sustainable and people-centric in its delivery. We must continue to review the scheme periodically to ensure that it serves our people expediently and compassionately in their time of need.

(In Mandarin)  I support the Online Safety (Relief and Accountability) Bill. The Bill is timely. The Bill will empower the newly established OSC to take action against users who abuse the Internet to harm others. Victims of online harassment or malicious disclosure of their privacy will receive more timely and comprehensive protection and will be able to seek compensation. The Commission will be able to instruct distributors of harmful content, platform administrators and platform operators to remove harmful content, restrict perpetrator accounts or publish victim responses. These measures will help curb many forms of online misconduct and are crucial for building a responsible and healthy online ecosystem. The enactment of this Bill is a landmark achievement in shaping a civilised, responsible and trustworthy online environment. I sincerely thank all relevant departments and the public for their efforts and contributions over the past five years. I am gratified and encouraged to see everyone working together to make the online environment safer and more civilised. The Internet's appeal lies in connecting people and ideas around the world, fostering understanding and solidarity. However, it has also been abused for disseminating pornography and violence, cyberbullying and inciting racial or religious conflict. Many of these misdeeds are carried out anonymously and this trend is escalating. Currently, the avenues for help available to Internet victims are extremely limited. Beyond the direct psychological and emotional harm, we are also seeing increasing indirect impacts. Many people are beginning to self-censor, even choosing to reduce their Internet use to protect themselves and their families. If we do not address this issue promptly, this online environment will further deteriorate. I welcome the establishment of the new OSC to enable victims to seek timely remedies. I cheer the Government's decision to enhance information and identity disclosures. Especially important is the introduction of statutory torts. They will provide victims the legal basis to seek accountability. I understand that enforcement will require significant resources and hence, the OSC will start with five of the 13 types of online harms, focusing on online harassment, doxxing, online stalking, intimate image abuse and image-based child abuse. I support the Ministry's plan to progressively expand coverage. At the same time, I would like to ask, when would the other online harms be progressively included? I would like to express appreciation on behalf of some of my residents who have shared they have been victims of doxxing. They shared that their addresses, car numbers and details of when they are resting are being shared online, as are videos and photos showing their family members, neighbours and visitors. I would like to ask the Minister whether the OSC will address such problems in online private chat groups, such as WhatsApp and Telegram? If so, what actions will the OSC take? In addition, the POHA provide protection from online harassment as well. How can victims decide on when to seek help from OSC or POHA? With this new legislative framework, new standards will be set for online behaviour and communication. Over time, these guidelines will guide our Internet users. I urge relevant departments to continue raising public awareness of this new framework and its corresponding penalties. Internet abusers must understand that they can no longer easily hide behind seemingly anonymous avatars and commit offences, they would be punished if they do so. Under the Bill, individuals may be fined up to $20,000 and jailed for up to 12 months, while entities may be fined up to $500,000 for failing to comply with the OSC’s orders. I urge the Ministries to consider increasing the caps for the fines and jail terms and include caning, to empower judges to have more discretion for particularly egregious crimes. In the UK, the Online Safety Act can impose penalties of up to S$31 million."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

So, my concern is that we do not know what is beyond the horizon. My question is, how can we make the system more efficient and effective so that if some NPS, some new drug comes up on the market, we are able to have the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) work together, get it under the Class C and therefore, administered. Because without it being a Schedule drug, we cannot consider them  the people who traffic, as traffickers; the people who consume, as consumers. So, it is critical in the legal stratosphere to have this efficiently, effectively and promptly scheduled as a Class C drug. That is my genuine concern.

My clarification revolves around how we debated this extensively in 2017, over two days. It was a very difficult debate; emotional. Mr Lee had only passed two years prior to that. Our then-Prime Minister responded and then, then-Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, at the time, gave what I thought was an excellent conclusion that a future Government, in the fullness of time, on the passage of time, will have to make that decision. Here we are today and the Minister is now speaking, on behalf of that Government, albeit at an initial stage. So, here I speak and seek clarification that as we move forward, that we realise there are many different interpretations of Mr Lee's wishes and preferences. And when eventually the Government, the good government of the day, makes this decision, to – I humbly request – be sensitive, be tactful in the explanations, as to why we are doing, or why it is doing what it is doing. I listened to Ms Chong's question and I also listened to Mr Liang's question, and I think they are both very good questions. We have a parallel Founders' Memorial, which actually is suppose to give the history, the ethos, the value system of our founding fathers. And I understand that the authenticity of the location of 38 Oxley Road differentiates itself from the Founders' Memorial, but I ask also for a deeper explanation, as the time comes, as to why the Government eventually makes its decision. And here I say this, with the House's interest at heart, with Singapore's interests at heart and Mr Lee Kuan Yew's interests at heart and overall, the Government's. I do apologise for going on a little bit more, but for those of us who were not in the House, I can say that it was certainly one of the most difficult speeches I gave. And we have now come to that situation where we have to make a decision in a future government.

In many cases, a speaker may mention an existing policy or one suggested by another speaker, but not necessarily agree with it. They may mention it to segue into a different topic, to ask questions about it, or even to disagree with it. This should not be included in the speaker's list of positions, since they did not advocate for it. Remember that your job is to list positions that the speaker expressed, not simply to summarize what they said.\n\nAdhere strictly to the following writing style: \n\n1. Use concise language but liberally include specifics of policies if they are present, rather than summarizing them generically. If necessary, always choose detail over succinctness.\n\n2. Do not expand acronyms, just leave them as they are.\n\n3. Output should be a bullet list with '-' used as the bullet.\n\n4. State the policy position directly rather than use action words. For example, 'Emphasize the importance of supporting youths financially' should simply be 'support youths financially'. Remember that the output is not a summary of the speech but a list of policy positions.\n"}, "Topic": {"type": "string", "description": "The topic of the speech chosen ONLY from one from these topics: [Education, Urban Planning, Public Health, Communications and Technology, Housing Policy, Family and Social Welfare, Transport, Art and Culture, Law and Justice, Environment and Climate, Sport, Foreign policy, Military Defense and National Security, Economic Development and Trade, Labour, Budget and Taxation]. \n"}}, "required": ["Positions", "Topic"], "additionalProperties": false}}}}}
