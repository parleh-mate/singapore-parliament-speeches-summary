To ride on this growth, Singapore is investing in Terminal 5, the Changi East industrial zone and Changi East urban district. We are also anchoring new investments for the aerospace sector. With these developments, opportunities in the aviation and aerospace sectors, which collectively employ over 80,000 workers today, are expected to grow. Tripartite partners have also been advancing efforts on several fronts to ensure that these sectors remain attractive to Singaporeans. First, tripartite partners have promoted and supported job redesign and technology adoption. In August 2024, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) announced the first pilot project between SATS and NTUC to improve jobs and make them more attractive to Singaporeans. With the support of the Air Transport Executive Staff Union and the SATS Workers' Union, SATS leveraged the NTUC Company Training Committee Grant to transform jobs in passenger services, cargo and apron operations. The Civil Aviation Authority Singapore (CAAS) has also signed a memorandum of understanding with AI Singapore and aviation companies to accelerate overall artificial intelligence capability building. Second, tripartite partners have expanded training and upskilling opportunities. Workforce Singapore's Career Conversion Programme (CCP) has broadened the aviation and aerospace sectors' talent pool by reskilling mid-career new hires or existing employees into growth job roles with good, longer-term prospects.

Consequently, approximately 7,000 more commuters have benefitted. Instead of taking the North-East Line (NEL) during the morning peak period, about eight in 10 adjusted their travel time on NEL to before or after peak hours, while the rest switched to taking buses. Adoption rate of Travel Smart Journeys is still low and we are looking to enhance the programme to encourage more commuters to consider shifting their timing or changing their mode of transport. To enjoy the benefits of TSJ, commuters can easily enrol through the SimplyGo app. Points can then be calculated and awarded to their account for each eligible journey. Use of the SimplyGo app allows commuters to accumulate points before redeeming in blocks and encourages sustained use of the TSJ programme.

As axle box failures are not common, SMRT had not undertaken a detailed engineering and risk assessment specific to extending the overhaul interval for the axle box.

Companies that receive Government support must make significant investments in Singapore and meet key outcomes, such as job creation and local employment, business spending or fixed asset investment. The level of support and conditions vary depending on the nature of the project and incentive. Should a company fail to meet the imposed conditions, the Government has mechanisms to terminate the incentive and claw back the grants provided. Our competitive strengths go beyond the financial incentives we provide. Singapore has built up a strong reputation as a global business hub, underpinned by our stable political environment, strong rule of law, deep pool of talent, excellent infrastructure and connectivity with the world. These attributes also enable us to compete on the basis of value and not simply on cost. On Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 2.0 Pillar Two, Singapore implemented the Domestic Top-up Tax and the Multinational Enterprise Top-up Tax from 1 January 2025. This was to avoid ceding revenues to other jurisdictions under the Pillar Two rules. In June 2025, the G7 released a statement on how the Pillar Two rules may co-exist \"side-by-side\" with the United States tax system. Discussions on the details of such a framework are ongoing. It is still unclear at the moment what the eventual outcome will be, and how other jurisdictions and multinational enterprises will respond. Hence, the impact on our fiscal outlook is uncertain.

In practice, the trains are not filled to the maximum because commuters decide not to board the train if it gets too crowded. But today, when we track the loading of the trains, it is in and around four passengers per sqm, which is not anywhere near the operating performance standard. In terms of the technical limitations of improving the capacity of the train lines, the free off-peak travel programme is one of a suite of measures that we have to try to manage the overall capacity of the train in terms of optimising it, but also to reduce the peak level crowding. Beyond that, we have been adding new trains to the NEL over the years. We have improved the signalling systems so that the headways between the trains have come down significantly. Outside of the train system, we have also added City Direct buses to bring people from their residence in the North East to the city centre. As for whether or not we can add more train carriages, that is often suggested. In Singapore, we have not taken this step because most of our train lines are underground and if we have trains that are longer than the station length, firstly, you either have to shut down the line to expand the station or there would be fire safety considerations because the carriages that do not have the exit doors, passengers would have to come through a longer way to get out and typically, that is not recommended for us to do that. So, we have not taken that step yet. What we have done is, for future lines, going forward, to see if we can budget for stations that are longer, in advance, and then, perhaps, in future, to only have smaller capacity trains and to extend the capacity of those trains when we need to."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

By shifting a small proportion of peak hour commuters who are able and willing to travel off-peak, we improve the commuting experience for those who still have to travel when it is most crowded. Redistributing the peak load also enables the overall capacity of the train line to be more efficiently used. Furthermore, a smaller peak load will reduce the impact of a train delay or disruption, if it happens. When we introduced a similar free travel programme in 2013, about 7% of commuters shifted out of the morning peak.

The scheme applies to the NEL for two reasons. The first is that this is the most well used part of our MRT network at present and we think we want to see whether we can optimise the off-peak crowding on that line. The second reason is that for parts of the NEL that are above Kovan station at the moment, they do not have an alternative route to the MRT network, until the Cross Island Line is built in five years time. And so, should there be a disruption and when there is a disruption, actually, the impact is quite significant to manage. Therefore, it is in our interest to try to reduce the peak hour crowding as much as we can. Bishan, in relative terms, is slightly less crowded, more well-connected. So, for the moment, we have decided to keep the pilot to the NEL. On the second question on accessibility, I fully understand the Member's concerns. Our objective with the scheme is to move a small proportion of those who are able and willing to move from peak hour travel to off-peak. And we are giving them a little incentive to do so. This will not only benefit these commuters, but it will also benefit the commuters who have no choice but to travel during the more crowded periods. It will benefit them through having less crowded trains, hopefully shorter waiting times for the trains and generally a better commuter experience for them. So, it is a win-win situation for all.

On the whole, in the longer term, what agencies do is they do plan the transport infrastructure and the capacity of the transport infrastructure in tandem with housing developments. The time frames are long for an MRT line – it takes about 15 years to build. And housing is about five years for a new BTO estate. So, they try to make sure that is synchronised. But in the short term, on a year-to-year basis, we also make continuous adjustments, whether it is adding new buses or in this case, proposing this free off-peak travel scheme. And I think overall the objective is to optimise the capacity of the train network, in particular, of specific trains during peak hours and to make for a better travel experience for our commuters.

There is no additional cost to taxpayers for such re-excavation works. The respective utility service providers are responsible for the full cost of the works, including any road resurfacing or re-excavation required to maintain their networks.  At times, due to the extensive and interconnected utility networks beneath the roads, works need to be carried out in stages. The Road Opening Coordination Committee (ROCC), chaired by LTA, does not direct the implementation of road works, but facilitates the coordination of works across government agencies and utility service providers. Where feasible, we deploy solutions to facilitate maintenance without repeated road excavations. Both Common Services Tunnels (CSTs) and other solutions such as Utilities Specific Ducts (USDs) achieve this purpose by consolidating and allowing easier access to utility infrastructure such as water pipes, electrical cables and telecommunication cables. CSTs are large tunnels which allow inspection and maintenance throughout the tunnel, and are suited for areas with high infrastructure loads, such as the Marina Bay area. USDs are smaller ducts, and are more suitable for the needs of HDB estates.

Sir, we are operating in a much more challenging global economic landscape. Geopolitical rivalries have intensified. Economic competition has sharpened. Many countries are home-shoring key industries and companies. The competition for investment is fiercer than ever before. At the same time, global tax and tariff rules continue to evolve, creating uncertainty and complicating companies' decisions on when and where to invest. For Singapore to continue to be a choice location for businesses to expand and invest, we must keep our tax system up-to-date, responsive to industry needs and aligned with global tax developments. The Bill today serves two purposes. First, the amendments to the Multinational Enterprise (Minimum Tax) Act incorporate updates to the Pillar Two rules under the international Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 2.0 initiative. Second, the Bill also brings into legal effect several tax measures already announced in this year's Budget Statement, as well as other changes to our tax system, following close consultations with the industry. I will now briefly outline the amendments to the Multinational Enterprise (Minimum Tax) Act. Last year, Parliament approved the enactment of the Act to implement the Domestic Top-up Tax and the Multinational Enterprise Top-up Tax under the Pillar Two rules. The rules require large multinational enterprises to pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, wherever they operate. Our implementation of the Pillar Two rules is aligned with the global implementation of these rules. Major economies, such as the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK) and Japan have already implemented them. Both top-up taxes apply to businesses' financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2025. Since the enactment of the Act, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Inclusive Framework has published new technical clarifications on the Pillar Two rules. Clauses 56 to 70 of the Bill will incorporate these and other technical clarifications into our legislation, so that our regime remains up-to-date and consistent and is recognised by other jurisdictions. This will provide certainty to businesses, ease their compliance burdens and most importantly, relieve them from having to pay Pillar Two taxes elsewhere in respect of their Singapore operations. Meanwhile, we are closely monitoring international developments. Negotiations on the parameters of Pillar Two have re-opened following the June 2025 G7 statement on the development of a \"side-by-side\" system that will exempt United States (US)-parented multinational enterprises from specific Pillar Two rules. At this point, discussions at the OECD Inclusive Framework are ongoing. It is unclear what the final outcome will be, and how other jurisdictions and affected businesses will respond. For the moment, our considerations for the implementation of the Domestic Top-up Tax and Multinational Enterprise Top-up Tax remain valid. We are, therefore, proceeding with the implementation of Pillar Two taxes, so that we do not cede tax revenues to other Pillar Two-implementing jurisdictions, and at the same time, we provide tax certainty for multinational enterprises to plan their investments. We will continue to monitor global developments and if necessary, review this approach. Sir, I will now highlight key amendments to the Income Tax Act, which cover changes to our corporate income tax and personal income tax regimes. The corporate income tax amendments ensure that our tax system remains responsive to business needs and practices. Clause 19 provides for a 100% tax deduction for expenses incurred by businesses on green certificates or credits. This is in response to feedback from businesses for more support in their sustainability journeys. Currently, tax deductions are only available when certificates or credits are surrendered or retired to meet statutory requirements. But with this amendment, tax deductions will now also apply if these certificates or credits are used to meet sustainability commitments. Clauses 27, 34 and 42 introduce tax incentives recommended by the Equities Market Review Group, set out at Budget this year. These incentives aim to encourage new listings in Singapore's equities market and increase investment demand for Singapore-listed equities. First, companies that complete a primary or secondary listing with shares offered in conjunction with the listing will enjoy a 20% or 10% Listing Corporate Income Tax Rebate, respectively, subject to caps. Second, we will also introduce a 5% concessionary tax rate on qualifying income for new fund manager listings in Singapore. And third, we will introduce a tax exemption on fund managers' qualifying income from funds with at least 30% allocation to Singapore-listed equities. Moving on to personal income tax, the amendments relate mainly to changes that provide stronger support to our workers. Clause 55 provides for all tax-resident individuals to receive a Personal Income Tax Rebate of 60% for the Year of Assessment 2025, capped at $200 per taxpayer. This was announced in Budget 2025 as part of the SG60 package and is granted automatically to eligible taxpayers. Let me conclude. Mr Speaker, the provisions in the Bill will update our tax regime to strengthen our economic competitiveness, provide more clarity to businesses and give more support to companies and individuals amidst a challenging global economic landscape.

I ask for, first of all, for everybody's understanding that I will not be able to address everybody's suggestions today, and this includes Mr Kenneth Tiong's suggestions on equities market improvements, which are outside the scope of this Bill. In line with the Standing Order 70(2), specifying that the Second Reading should be on the general merits and principle of the Bill, let me first respond to some of the points that are more specific to the Bill that other colleagues have raised. Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Victor Lye have asked whether we would adjust our implementation of Pillar Two top-up taxes if other jurisdictions slow or reverse their adoption and whether this would affect our economic competitiveness. Let me try to briefly recap how Pillar Two rules work without ChatGPT. When a multinational enterprise is taxed below the minimum effective rate of 15% in a jurisdiction, other jurisdictions will have the right to impose a top-up tax on the multinational enterprise. This design ensures that the multinational enterprises pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% wherever they operate, even if some jurisdictions choose not to implement the rules. Therefore, if we do not implement the Pillar Two taxes, we will cede tax revenue to other jurisdictions as the affected multinational enterprises would have to pay these taxes to other jurisdictions that have implemented Pillar Two rules. The reopening of negotiations on Pillar Two, including the side-by-side solution, seeks to exempt US multinational enterprises from some of the Pillar Two rules has, indeed, created some uncertainty. But our key consideration for imposing the Pillar Two taxes, to avoid ceding tax revenue, remains valid for now. It is far from clear what the final arrangement will be. As Mr Shawn Loh said, the less we know, the more we should prepare. And so, MOF will continue to monitor developments very closely and recalibrate our approach, if needed, if and when the situation changes. Mr Louis Chua asked if companies that received the RIC are required to adopt the arm's length principle. The answer is, yes, the RIC recipients must ensure that qualifying expenditures incurred from transactions with related parties are at arm's length. [Please refer to \"Clarification by Senior Minister of State for Finance\", Official Report, 6 November 2025, Vol 96, Issue 11, Correction By Written Statement section.] Mr Shawn Loh spoke about the importance of enhancing Singapore's value proposition to global enterprises and let me assure Members that this is a key priority for the Government. While Pillar Two may reduce the room for tax competition amongst jurisdictions, the competition for foreign investment has intensified. The Prime Minister explained during past Budget debates that, although BEPS 2.0 was meant to tilt the playing field in favour of governments and to make MNEs pay more taxes, in reality, such enterprises wield considerable leverage, and this is why governments everywhere are, therefore, still spending significant sums to attract investments. Fortunately, our economic competitiveness is not based solely on tax incentives, but on the strength of our overall business ecosystem. And this includes many factors – a deep pool of human capital, strong rule of law, long-term investments in infrastructure and connectivity, and our capacity to deploy and diffuse new technologies. We are confident about Singapore's economic future. But at the same time, we are under no illusions to the fact that we have to compete harder in this new world where the rules matter less and strategic heft matters more. This is why we established the Economic Strategy Review Committee in August to refresh our economic blueprint. I chair one of the committees on global competitiveness with Senior Minister of State Low Yen Ling. We are developing ideas to strengthen Singapore's value proposition in the global economy to build new growth sectors, such as advanced manufacturing precision medicine and artificial intelligence; to attract fast growing companies from the US, China, India and elsewhere; to strengthen Singapore's position as a global hub in the flows of goods, capital, talent, data, energy and ideas. The objective, as always, is to secure good growth for Singapore and good jobs for Singaporeans. And this is why our tax system will have to complement the strategy too. At the company level, we do regularly review the tax system to ensure that it is responsive to industry needs and feedback, and that is why MOF has consulted extensively with SMEs, trade associations and chambers for this Bill. I would like to thank Mr Saktiandi and Mr Lye for their suggestions on tax compliance and support for businesses. Facilitating businesses' tax compliance has been, and always will be, a priority for IRAS. In this regard, IRAS has been publishing e-tax guides and updating its website to provide clearer guidance for businesses. IRAS has also simplified the tax filing processes for small businesses, such as by reducing the amount of information that they need to submit in their tax returns. Pillar Two rules are complex, and to help taxpayers better understand and comply with these rules, IRAS has also set up a dedicated mailbox and published e-learning videos and an e-tax guide on the top-up taxes for the businesses to refer to. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim also asked on the compliance requirement for securitisation entities. Our approach to the top-up tax on such entities, or how we would impose the top-up tax is similar to the treatment in other jurisdictions, including in Australia and Hong Kong. This is to avoid ceding tax revenue to foreign jurisdictions that impose Pillar Two taxes on securitisation entities income. To ensure that securitisation transactions remain viable in Singapore, securitisation entities will not be liable for unpaid tax liability of the multinational enterprise or appointed as a filing entity unless it is the only constituent entity here, MOF and IRAS will also work closely with businesses and industry associations to address other remaining areas of concern and to further ease the compliance burden for businesses. Mr Saktiandi asked about Singapore's implementation plans for the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework. This framework provides for the automatic exchange of information on crypto assets for tax purposes with partner jurisdictions. IRAS has announced that Singapore expects to commence these exchanges in 2028 and has been in close consultation with the industry since last year, and it will provide further guidance to the industry in due course. Mr Saktiandi further highlighted that the short window of the listing corporate income tax rebate incentive and its administrative requirements could discourage participation, and he asked whether or not as well whether the rebate would be effective given our implementation of Pillar Two taxes. While tax measures may be less relevant for large multinational enterprises that are affected by Pillar Two, they will still benefit small businesses or smaller businesses. Ultimately, it is up to each enterprise to consider its own circumstances before applying for any incentive. MOF will monitor the effectiveness of these incentives and we will be open to making further adjustments if necessary. Mr Chua spoke about how we should review our tax incentives for family officers to strengthen their economic outcomes for Singapore. Indeed, this is what Singapore does for all of our incentives on a regular basis, and I agree with him and I thank him for his feedback. Mr Victor Lye suggested setting a clear timeline to extend the enhancement to the 20%-shareholding condition for section 13W tax exemption of disposal gains to registered business trusts and variable capital companies. MOF will indeed study the feasibility of his suggestion, but please give us some time as the ownership structures of registered business trusts and variable capital companies are complex. I would like to also inform Mr Saktiandi that the employment condition does not apply to the corporate tax rebate. This is because a tax-paying company would be considered an active company, and this approach allows for greater administrative efficiency while still meeting our intent of supporting active companies. However, section 92L(5) does give the Government the flexibility to adjust the employment condition if companies are unable to meet it due to unforeseen circumstances. Finally, I would like to thank Mr Shawn Loh, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Louis Chua for their views on providing more support for our workers. Indeed, we have shared the upsides of Singapore's economic growth, including through tax rebates with Singaporeans. The SG60 package this year includes a 60% personal income tax rebate to all tax resident individuals. This rebate is estimated to cost almost $400 million. Mr Saktiandi and Mr Louis Chua suggested making structural changes to our tax system to provide more support for individuals, such as reducing the rates for the lowest income tax brackets, or to increase the quantum of our tax reliefs. Mr Chua also suggested reviewing our personal income tax exemption threshold of $20,000. Our personal income tax exemption threshold is already higher than jurisdictions like Australia and Malaysia, where thresholds range from $1,500 to $16,000. Taken together with our progressive tax rates, tax reliefs and rebates, already around 40% of workers do not pay income tax in Singapore. For those who do, about 80% have an effective tax rate of less than 6%. I thank Mr Chua for his various suggestions to enhance the personal tax regime, and we will continue to regularly review the personal tax regime to ensure that it remains fair and progressive. I would like to share with Mr Saktiandi that the training allowances provided under the Workfare Skills Support - Basic scheme will not be taxed so that the lower-wage workers who undertake training can receive the full benefits of training allowances. Most lower-wage workers, as I said, do not already pay income tax, but in the event that any worker has paid income tax on the training allowances received, the amendment allows them to obtain a refund of the taxes paid, and this will be publicised by Workforce Singapore, so that such individuals can come forward to do so, Mr Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, as a small open economy, Singapore must remain nimble and responsive to global developments. Our fundamentals are strong, and we are well placed to seize opportunities amidst the shifts in the global economic environment, this Tax Bill will update our tax regime to provide more clarity to businesses and to respond to industry feedback, and this is a key part of our overall effort to strengthen Singapore's economic competitiveness as the global landscape continues to evolve.

In my speech today, I will speak on two points that President Tharman highlighted in his speech  a more pronounced need for unity; and a strong economy – the need to transform and innovate to enhance our value as a trusted hub to ensure opportunities for all Singaporeans. For Singapore, our people and the ethos of unity and progress for all, regardless of race, language or religion is the cornerstone of the success of our improbable nation these last 60 years. Our leaders have been intentional in forging our unity while celebrating our diversity through integrated housing policy, education, meritocratic governance, shared values and long-term stewardship. But Singapore's unity and identity is not static. It is changing, shaped in what is happening in our everyday life in Singapore and globally. So while vital, forging our unity today is no longer just around integrating and celebrating our diversity of race, language or religion. Our population is ageing. Our society is more diverse and younger Singaporeans are voicing new hopes for fairness, autonomy and purpose. Digitalisation is reshaping our daily lives. Differences in access can result in who gets access to services, whose voice travels, and what \"truths\" feel credible. Hence, people may end up living in different realities even when they are under the same space. Personalised feeds cluster people into like-minded bubbles, reinforcing beliefs and isolating them from shared facts, where information we consume fragments our shared realities. These changes are deeply personal. They shape how we see ourselves, how we relate to one another across age, income, race, religion, cultures and education. People are experiencing Singapore differently. Some feel secured and heard, others feel left out, or unsure where they fit in. If we do not respond to these lived realities, unity becomes fragile not because we disagree, but because we stop feeling part of. So, how do we move forward together? We need to refresh our social compact. This means rethinking the roles we each play. Government, employers, individuals and building a culture of shared responsibility. It means designing policies that reflect real lives, not just averages. Designing for lived experience and not just aggregated outcomes. And it means ensuring that opportunity is not just promised but felt. We must design systems that are truly inclusive. Housing, education, work, digital platforms, they must work for everyone across life stages and backgrounds. We need to support transitions, whether it is a mid-life career shift, a young person finding their voice, a first-time home owner getting a flat or an older adult staying connected. It is not sufficient just to take feedback. We must create space for real dialogue. Not just consultation, but co-creation. We need platforms where people can speak honestly, listen deeply and shape the future together. Trust grows when people see that their stories matter and that their feedback leads to change. Let me give you a small example from our community in Changi Simei, what we call VIASTA!. What began as a simple idea to activate the under-utilised space under the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) viaduct to promote residents' well-being has blossomed into a vibrant festival. Residents did not just give their feedback but worked together with grassroots leaders, community partners and agencies, research and design teams from Singapore University of Technology and Design, SingHealth and Changi General Hospital to co-create, design and transform the space under the MRT viaduct near Simei station. From booths and programmes run by residents, seniors and youths, students and teachers from our schools and tertiary institutions, hospital and healthcare professionals, kopi chat with the Police and movie under the stars, VIASTA! has become a celebration of shared ownership and provides a space that comes alive to benefit the well-being of our residents in Changi Simei. Although the process required several months to collect residents' feedback and collaboratively utilising AI to visualise the desired VIASTA!, it enabled meaningful participation from both residents and stakeholders. They could see their ideas come to life. This approach ensured that all perspectives and expertise were incorporated, fostering an inclusive environment for co-creation and effective decision-making. We now have had three iterations of VIASTA! in the last one year, where residents, community partners and agencies came together to bring VIASTA! alive. The fourth VIASTA! is scheduled for November this year. On a national level, Forward Singapore provided a platform that brought together citizens, employers, communities and Government to co-create policies that reflect evolving aspirations around work, family, education and purpose. Given the volatility as well as the fragmented and fast-moving world we face, we need to continue to have such platforms and I am very heartened to hear Prime Minister Lawrence Wong talk about this deeper engagement, deeper engagement with Singaporeans to be able to co-create policies together. Some may pooh-pooh. Some may actually say, \"That is too hard, it takes too long.\" But I think that it is worth the effort and we have seen the policies from Forward Singapore, ideas and feedback from Singaporeans coming to life in our policies already today and I encourage every Singaporean, especially our young, but every Singaporean to really make the effort to come forward and be involved. Unity in Singapore has never been about sameness. It is about shared purpose. And that purpose must evolve as we do, grounded in empathy, trust and courage to change together. Let me touch on the point of the need for a strong economy. If we want growth, we do need to have a strong economy to attract talent and investments. With the current uncertainties and structural shifts that are affecting Singapore, we must support the efforts that Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong has shared about refreshing Singapore's economic blueprint and keeping Singapore's economy strong and resilient by enhancing Singapore's value as a base for leading firms, a key global business hub and a vital connector to the global economy. The strength of our economy lies not in discrete moments of growth, but in sustainable progress. This will then lead to opportunities for businesses and the creation of jobs that are relevant to the new world order. But more importantly, strong sustainable growth will create quality and meaningful jobs for Singaporeans. Economic growth is not just about numbers. It is about people. It is about giving every Singaporean that chance to thrive, to contribute and to shape the future we share. Technological disruption is accelerating workforce transitions, creating both opportunities and anxieties, affecting opportunities for our young and matured workers. This brings me to the point on what do we do to ensure that businesses contribute to developing an empowered workforce that is ready to seize the opportunities and create jobs. The Ministry of Manpower's strategic plan to build a future-ready workforce by encouraging a skills-first approach to hiring will help unlock new talent pools, giving individuals a fair shot based on their skills. Supporting companies to create rich career pathways within their organisations, and I repeat this, within the organisation. As they transform, it is important to help retain and stretch our talent, to help them grow and allow them to thrive with these changes. To drive the transformation of the workforce from within the organisation, I am glad that the Tripartite Workgroup on Human Capital Capability Development will support the uplifting of human resources professions and the Enterprise Workforce Transformation Package will seek to ensure that the technology becomes a tool for inclusion and not displacement. But as we look ahead, we need to take one step back and ask ourselves if we can take a larger view of the whole system and not just specific segments, such as our young graduates, mid-career or matured workers. Is there a better way to achieve our desire of an empowered and future-ready workforce? How can we bring our learning systems to support our people to be work ready? I have spoken many times in this House that Singapore must grow and have opportunities to give Singaporeans fulfilling jobs and I believe having meaningful work gives Singaporeans confidence not just to make a living which is very important but also to feel included and to have a sense of purpose, belonging and commitment to the community and to the nation. We must ensure that every Singaporean, regardless of age or background, or where we start, can aspire to seize these opportunities. That means investing in skills, supporting career transitions, designing workplaces that are inclusive and progressive. It means refreshing our economic blueprint to stay nimble in a complex world – so that growth uplifts and not divides. So, how can we wholistically rethink our learning systems in an age of rapid change, and disruptions? Our learning system today is front-loaded and segmented. Internships help to mitigate with opportunities for industry exposure. But how can we build an ecosystem that supports and empowers our workforce to be work ready? I think apprenticeship can prepare our young for work and cultivate lifelong learning. By combining work exposure and integrating it with the learning in schools, it may serve as a means to develop a workforce that is adaptable and inclusive. It offers not just skills, but purpose – through real-world experience, mentorship and meaningful contribution. To unlock its full potential, employers must step up earlier, much earlier in designing pathways with schools, offering industry exposure before graduation and guiding young talent from the start. This early engagement strengthens the bridge between learning and work, aspiration and opportunity. By embedding structured, hands-on learning within real-world settings, apprenticeships also offer a scalable pathway for mid-career transitions, intergenerational knowledge transfer, and inclusive talent development. Strategically, apprenticeships embed adaptability, deepen knowledge transfer, and foster lifelong learning. They do not just fill jobs. They have the potential to renew industries, empower individuals, and help Singapore stay agile in a fast-changing world. Mr Speaker, unity and opportunity are two sides of the coin. When we build stronger bonds and access to opportunities, we deepen the sense that this country is worth investing in – not only for ourselves, but for one another; a Singapore that we are proud to call home.

Many families were coming to appeal because they do want to stay with their families. I noted Minister's point about the numbers in terms of those who had a queue number because I had several residents who came to see me who had many more attempts, some with three or four attempts at BTO applications, and were not successful. To give the context, for inter-generational caregiving needs, many do want to stay within the area, not just in Simei, for my residents of course, but even in the East they have been applying. Given that these proximity schemes or other priority schemes are giving residents more ballot opportunities, would the Ministry of National Development consider refinement to the balloting process that would allow the Proximity Scheme to give real priority for those who have attempted several times within an area that is close to their family, or may be, perhaps, even in extending the proximity area, may be beyond the four kilometre?

And some, their jobs are disrupted and for someone older, especially a matured professional, it is usually harder to get a job at that age. And so, therefore, it is relevant, and they have no income and if they happen to live in a property that is just slightly above the threshold, they do not qualify.

The proposed enhancements reinforce Singapore’s commitment to inclusive and future-ready care. It clarifies who qualifies for coverage and strengthens how the scheme is administered and communicated. These refinements lay the groundwork for enhanced benefits for CareShield Life from 2026, including higher monthly payouts and moderated premium increases, ensuring that long-term care for severe disabilities remains accessible and fair. CareShield Life offers lifetime monthly payouts for those who are severely disabled. This goes some ways to help families manage the emotional and financial weight of caregiving. The Scheme is based on our ethos of shared responsibility – where individuals, families and the Government co-contribute to care financing. The proposed amendments clarify the eligibility criteria of CareShield Life for the Optional Group – those born in 1979 or before, or aged 46 and above in 2025. The intent is to ensure fair and consistent eligibility and claims for the cohort while balancing inclusivity with scheme sustainability. These proposed enhancements are welcomed moves. But as we refine CareShield Life, we must also examine the lived realities of those navigating it. So, while I support the proposed amendments, there are a few points I would like to speak on  one, the underwriting criterion for the Optional Group and the implications for them; two, the affordability of premiums for retirees without subsidy support Given the importance of coverage for severe disability and to encourage more in the Optional Group to sign-up for CareShield Life, currently those with milder forms of disability can sign up for CareShield Life. And as the Senior Minister of State has shared, this was a very deliberate decision to allow for some limited time for people to sign up. The Bill proposes the reinstatement of the underwriting criterion for the Optional Group to moderate premium for older policy holders. With the proposed amendment, eligibility now is tied to their disability status. This means that they can only enrol in CareShield Life if they do not have any pre-existing disability as defined in clause 8 of the Bill and the new Fourth Schedule. The definition states that a person is “not disabled” if he or she is able to do all of the ADLs. This intent is to prevent adverse selection risk, where those who are more likely to claim, opt in for CareShield Life. I do agree with the rationale for this stricter definition as it provides clarity of eligibility as it also prevents adverse selection risk. This will keep the scheme fair and more importantly, more sustainable. It does however mean that those in the Optional Cohort with mild disability, who would have qualified under the current time-limited requirements of mild disabilities will now not be able to be covered. And as the Senior Minister of State has shared, this is concerning because one in two individuals in their lifetime will encounter severe disability. These individuals may need the coverage as they age. Since the launch of CareShield Life, as the Senior Minister of State has shared, 1.9 million Singapore Residents have joined the scheme with 900,000 of them, or half of that population of the Optional Cohort opting in. That being the case, we still have 900,000 not covered, and some of them may not have opted in due to perhaps not fully understanding the scheme and therefore not having the coverage. I know that there has already been time given, but I do suggest and I do think that we must do more to help them navigate the full sweep and to understand the caregiving support. I am not suggesting that we force this group to sign up, but what I think we have to do is ensure that people understand the full sweep of the Government schemes available so that they can make more informed decisions and more confident decisions for their long-term care financing. I know that the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) today, as well as the Silver Generation Office play a central role in providing resources and helpline to reach out and help families understand care options, eligibility and application processes. I think more of us in the community need to understand these care options better and to help seniors with low digital literacy and also their caregivers understand the suite of long-term care financing support schemes available. Why does this matter? It matters because it helps bridge the last mile of families who lack coverage and who may not proactively seek help as they may be unaware or just too overwhelmed with their caregiving needs. I would like to speak about affordability of premiums. The affordability of CareShield Life premiums is tightly coupled with the Bill which lays the ground work for the enhancements proposed by the CareShield Life Council, which the Government has accepted fully. And this includes the recommendation for higher payouts and correspondingly higher premiums to keep the scheme sustainable. There is concern about affordability of long-term care for those who do not qualify for subsidy support, particularly retirees. These are often individuals who own modest assets but have limited cash flow. They fall just outside the means-tested thresholds, are caregivers for spouses or ageing parents while managing their own health. Several of my residents in Changi Simei do fall under this category. And the temporary transitional support for CareShield Life which is not means-tested is definitely welcome as it applies to all policy holders and it will moderate the premium increase to $38 per year on average and capped at $75 per year on average and can be fully paid by MediSave. The amount of increase may be small, but the retirees who are cash stretched that are not eligible for subsidy support for premiums, the increases may risk them opting out of the scheme even though they may be eligible and are vulnerable. I have called for long-term care policies and support to remain inclusive and responsive to our rapidly ageing population as long-term care is not a one-off but it is an ongoing expense, including premiums. So, based on the current means-testing criteria, if a household has no household income, the annual value (AV) of the home is used as the criterion. Given the higher property valuation in recent years, this impacts those living in modest private property with no income and who wish to age in place. The means testing criterion of AV of property applies not just to CareShield Life but to other long-term care schemes. Hence, those who fall in this category are not just impacted by higher premium for CareShield Life but eligibility for support of other long-term care schemes including MediSave Care, Home Caregiving Grant and the Elder Fund. I know that the Senior Minister of State did give multiple reassurances that no one will be denied of CareShield Life coverage if they cannot afford the scheme, but this goes beyond just CareShield Life. The principles of supporting our caregivers and their families goes beyond just the CareShield Life premium. So, I do encourage that we continue to review and refine the criterion as we go. We encourage families to be the main caregivers for their family members. In my engagement with our residents, it is heartening to see many families care of their elderly parents, siblings or relatives with disabilities and they live together. If they are living in a private property, AV is used for means testing and they are not eligible for the subsidy support for long-term care if they live in a private property, which generally, in my ward, falls beyond the current threshold. Can MOH consider refinement with the use of AV? Would MOH consider, for example, tiering the AV threshold by age, adjusting the AV cut-off for older cohorts who own only one property? In using AV as a criterion, can the number of those requiring caregiving and living in the household be a factor for assessment? This will support the sandwiched generation. Refining AV as a criterion for means testing for long-term care support is vital for our policies to keep pace with the evolving demographics and caregiving realities as Singapore's population ages. This will still preserve our ethos of shared responsibility, where individuals, families and the Government co-contribute to care financing. Mr Deputy Speaker, CareShield Life is an important component of Singapore's long-term care system, offering lifelong monthly payouts to support individuals who become severely disabled. It provides financial assurance at a time when care needs are high and income may be low, helping families manage the costs of home care, nursing services or caregiver support. Yet, we must ensure that Singaporeans understand that CareShield Life does not stand alone. It is complemented by a suite of targeted schemes like MediSave Care, which allows monthly withdrawals for care expenses; the Home Caregiving Grant, which offsets informal caregiving costs; and the ElderFund, which provides discretionary support for those with limited income and family help. Together, these schemes form a layered safety net that ensures affordability, dignity and inclusion across diverse care settings and life stages. I support the amendment as it ensures affordability and sustainability of CareShield Life while balancing inclusivity of the scheme."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

I am heartened by how our people and the Government have been working hand in hand to overcome the numerous waves of challenges pounding our shores. They emanate from continents far from our island – economic upheavals, armed conflicts, technology changes – yet, they have significant impact on our everyday lives. On the one hand, I am confident of our ability to catch some of these waves to survive and thrive. On the other hand, let us never forget the need to protect the vulnerable amongst us and prevent these powerful waves from sweeping them under. I am cognisant of the immense responsibility that my residents and fellow Singaporeans have entrusted me with. I applaud the great progress that we have made so far together to address some of the issues faced by our vulnerable groups. But our work is far from done and that is why I continue to champion change that will benefit Singaporeans and my residents and keep our country going in this new reality. MPs play an important role to help the Government to continue to review the effectiveness of our policies on the ground. Where necessary, we must be willing to recalibrate and make improvements to narrow the gaps and plug any loophole. Let us never forget that spirit of sensible policy-making and pragmatic government administration that has been a hallmark of Singapore's success. Sometimes, the solutions can be deceptively simple and I would like to call upon us all, the people, private and public sectors, to be daring to raise practical and smart solutions, and our policy-makers to listen to good ideas from our people. This is how we stay united as a nation, by caring and looking out for one another. It is worth reminding ourselves that we are only as strong as our weakest link and the tides of change must not leave anyone behind. I am assured and heartened by the commitments made by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) in its Addendum to the President's address. I support the suite of enhanced and new measures to help our families cope during this challenging period. I support the enhanced employment support and opportunities for lifelong education for lower-income families and persons with disabilities (PwDs). Reviews and updates of ComCare assistance and payouts, and Family Services are timely. I welcome the introduction of a new Domestic Violence Act and the commencement of the Mental Capacity Act review, just to name a few. Our social and healthcare workers play an essential and critical role in ensuring that appropriate help and care is provided in a timely manner. This was best demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, but now that we have moved on from that crisis, it does not mean that we forget their roles and contributions. In fact, I would like to urge the Government to consider dedicating more resources to our social care sector, in view of the needs arising from our rapidly ageing population, as our population pyramid starts to invert amid shrinking family sizes and changing social norms. Our social care workers are professionals and they must be treated as such. They need to be equipped with more support and resources in order to achieve better outcomes for their clients. Much research worldwide over the last two decades have resulted in new findings in this field and we can tap on these to provide constant professional upgrading so that they can be even more effective. In addition, we should elevate and accord better recognition of and compensation for their work. Due to the nature of their jobs, burnout and attrition rates are high. Their heart work is hard work. We have to do more to better retain our existing talent pool of social workers, while attracting new blood to boost our ability to care for our people. Foreign workers do help to fill many of the gaps, but let us not end up as a country that relies too heavily on others to take care of our very own. Singapore is rapidly ageing. Our silver tide is here. We must accelerate efforts to strengthen community-based eldercare, expanding Active Ageing Centres, daycare facilities and home-based support services. These not only enable our seniors to age-in-place, with dignity and autonomy, but also reduce pressure on families. Caregiving, often performed by middle-aged adults juggling work and family, must also be better supported. Caregivers want to be able to care for their families, but they also have their own dreams and aspirations. All too often, I have met residents who have had to sacrifice their careers to look after their loved ones. Indeed, they have chosen to do so out of love, and we need to celebrate that and provide them with better support. The toll that they experience goes beyond the physical and it is quite common that their mental well-being is also at risk. I urge the Government to consider enhanced caregiver leave, more accessible respite services and financial assistance tailored to caregiver households. Our seniors are not a burden; they are a blessing. Let us honour their contributions not just in words but through concrete policies that uphold their well-being as well as that of their loved ones. We have to double down on our efforts to support families holistically, so that they can remain strong and resilient in the face of change. For families under duress, our social care workers need to be empowered to coordinate with partners, such as mental and physical healthcare professionals, financial counsellors, schools, eldercare centres and so on. Sir, poverty in Singapore may be less visible, but we still have families struggling even for basic provisions, including food. Families living in rental flats, often headed by single parents or elderly caregivers, face daily struggles. For children in these households, we must do more to ensure their well-being and that they can access healthcare, nutritious food and be able to focus on their education. We must intervene early and effectively. Programmes like KidSTART are commendable and we need to go further in scaling them up, with holistic support for families – not just for children, but also for parents. Empower them with good parenting skills, stable employment, access to mentoring and even overcoming addictions, such as to vaping, alcohol and even drugs. Sir, we have watched with horror how divisive many countries overseas have become, splintering along racial and religious lines, and increasingly along the lines of immigration and social economic backgrounds. There are heightened tensions between established resident communities and new arrivals, and distrust between the rich and the poor, manifesting in rallies, riots and violence. Almost daily, we see alarming images of looting, burning vehicles and buildings, and people attacking each other on television and social media. Social harmony did not happen by chance. It is the result of careful stewardship, addressing root causes of problems as soon as they surface, building mutual respect and reaching the national consensus to agree to engage in difficult conversations, even over sensitive topics. Yet in today's digital age, we face new threats, from misinformation, polarisation and imported ideologies that can erode trust and amplify division. How can we build unity in diversity? Inter-faith platforms like the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs) must be re-energised for a new generation. Many of our youths that I met have good questions and think about such issues very seriously. Let us support engagements for deeper, ongoing conversations about faith, tradition and coexistence, especially among our youths. Civic education in schools should place greater emphasis on empathetic understanding of different faiths and worldviews. We must move beyond mere tolerance, to deepen our mutual understanding, appreciation and respect. Strong communities are not built by governments alone. They exist when neighbours look out for one another, when residents take ownership of shared spaces and when there is deep trust among people, in our institutions and in our leadership. We must also support faith and community leaders who work quietly to build bridges. Our bridge-builders must be seen, supported and safeguarded against threats. Our Community Development Councils (CDCs), Social Service Offices (SSOs) and grassroots organisations must continue to be strongly supported to work closely with ground-up groups and volunteers. Policies must enable not only professional help, but also \"kampung\"-style initiatives and mutual aid. One example where multiple stakeholders came together to try to solve a long-running problem is the Skyville@Dawson sky gardens. For years, residents have been putting up with the disamenities of noisy and inconsiderate visitors who litter, smoke, urinate and cause disturbances even in the wee hours. Volunteers, despite feeling burnout, continue with patrols, even as we continue to engage with HDB, the Town Council, Residents' Committees, NEA, the Police and other Government agencies. Unfortunately, the disamenities continued and we sought to present alternative solutions which have been proven effective in other sky gardens, such as the Pinnacle @ Duxton. When problems remain unsolved and proposals are not accepted, it is not surprising for my residents to feel disappointed. You may recall that in 2022, I moved an Adjournment Motion in this very House to explore solutions on how we can better manage our common spaces in housing estates. I will not hesitate to speak up for my residents if I feel that more can be done. Securing Singapore's future lies not in grand slogans, but as our President put it, in everyday deeds and action, like little acts of kindness; helping an elderly neighbour with groceries; guiding a child in need; and lending a hand in crisis. These are the encounters that strengthen our social compact and build a \"we first\" society. In closing, allow me to reiterate our first principles. To build a united and resilient Singapore, we have to be inclusive and caring, respectful of differences in diversity and united in core values. Every child who falls through the cracks, every elderly person who dies alone, every caregiver who burns out is a reminder of work yet to be done. Similarly, every neighbour who helps another, every volunteer who steps forward, every employer who provides a second chance, is a sign of the better Singapore that we are building together.

In particular, I would like to express my support for the alignment of enforcement powers against delinquent passenger behaviour for buses and trains, which I will focus my speech on. Buses are an integral part of our public transport system, complementing our MRT. To encourage more people to use our buses and help reduce the demand for private vehicles, the conduct of fellow passengers play a very important role. Mutual respect and considerate behaviour improve the travelling experience on our buses and help ensure safe, reliable and enjoyable journeys. Most passengers are mindful and cooperative, but we need to guard against potentially dangerous and disruptive behaviours on our public transport systems. Empowering our transportation teams, security and police officers through legislation is a fundamental step and will provide the necessary support for enforcement. In addition to legislative backing, transport officers should also be offered robust training on how to enforce the law fairly and sensitively. I would like to call for special attention to be given to how our officers will be trained to handle vulnerable commuters, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities or those with mental health challenges. There are also some important differences that may make addressing delinquent passengers a greater challenge on buses than on MRT trains. For example, all MRT trains will stop at MRT stations that are staffed by transport officers on duty, and have CCTVs and other safety features in place. However, for buses, this is not available except at the bus interchanges and bus drivers have to focus on driving the bus safely, navigating traffic conditions and looking after the safety of all passengers on board. We have also had cases where the bus driver's own personal safety was threatened by violence. Therefore, while bus drivers are often in the first line when it comes to delinquent behaviours on buses, we must remember not to add on to the stresses of their jobs. With enforcement powers now available, I hope that the Ministry will continue to prioritise the safety of our bus drivers as well, as this is being rolled out. Would we also be expecting more enforcement officers being deployed along bus routes as a result, or if bus drivers will be able to call for assistance from quick response teams if required? Sir, in Mandarin. (In Mandarin)  With enforcement powers are now available, I hope that the Ministry will continue to prioritise the safety of our bus drivers as this policy is being rolled out. We hope more enforcement officers will be deployed along bus routes so that our bus drivers will be able to call for assistance from quick response teams if required. (In English)  In addition to enforcement powers and penalties, I also believe that continued public education will help to serve as a reminder to all to exercise considerate and gracious behaviours on public transport. I hope that the Ministry will consider putting up such reminders on social media, radio stations, television, on buses and at interchanges to reinforce such messaging. I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

As our national insurance scheme for severe disabilities above the age of 30, CareShield Life plays an important role in helping to defray the costs of long-term care, having evolved from the ElderShield scheme from earlier days. As part of the enhancements, the planned underwriting criteria for Optional Cohorts born before 1980 will be reinstated. This will mean that persons with existing disabilities born before 1980 will not be able to join the scheme. But when we look at the bigger picture, this will help with reducing the uncertainty when the actuaries are calculating the premiums and thereby reducing the extent of premium increases for everyone in the Optional Cohorts. I am heartened to know that there will be other long-term care subsidies and grants available to them, such as the Home Caregiving Grant. I would like to call upon the Government to continue to monitor the situation for persons in the Optional Cohorts to ensure that they are able to afford the long-term care that they need. I would also like to ask if the Government has data on the percentage of this group who has made other plans to pay for the provision of long-term care, such as private insurance, and whether these plans are deemed sufficient. It is crucial that CareShield Life remains financially viable and sustainable. I can understand that the proposed annual increase in both payout growth rate and premiums from 2026 to 2030 can help to ensure that the scheme keeps pace with inflation and rising care costs. I understand that this enhancement will be reviewed after 2030, but it will be difficult to imagine that premiums will not continue to rise. I am assured by the Government's commitment of over $570 million in additional premium support to offset more than 30% of the premium increase over the next five years. These Government subsidies for the premiums, especially for the lower-income groups, enhance affordability and ensure majority participation in the scheme. I am also glad to note that the Government has reiterated that no one will lose coverage due to their inability to pay their premiums. I would like to ask the Minister, beyond the next five years of insurance premium support, what are the Government's plans to continue to ensure that CareShield Life remains affordable for our people in the face of rising premiums? CareShield Life is designed to provide basic financial support and reduce out-of-pocket expenses should an insured develop severe disability and need long-term care. For people that have to make a claim under CareShield Life, there could be other costs that cannot be fully covered by CareShield Life payouts, especially if they did not purchase a CareShield Life supplementary plan. In effect, while CareShield Life helps to defray the costs of long-term care, Singaporeans will have to continue to ensure that they have enough savings or funding sources to afford the type of long-term care that they need and not assume that the insurance scheme will take care of everything. I hope that the Government can consider raising public awareness about the types of costs that are associated with long-term care and the kinds of support that are available to them. Mr Speaker, in Mandarin.

(In English)  In conclusion, Mr Speaker, CareShield Life's long-term sustainability faces challenges from our ageing population, rising care costs and the limited coverage relative to actual expenses. Continued Government oversight and actuarial reviews will be essential to maintaining a balance between the adequacy of benefits and the affordability of premiums over the coming decades."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

I would like to speak on three areas today  sexual offences, protection of public servants and the revision of caning penalties, including for scams. First, I applaud the Ministry's move to update sexual offences to protect our people, especially the young and the vulnerable, in an ever-evolving digital landscape. The amendments proposed have been designed to be able to factor in future developments and trends in technology and social media. The Bill proposes enhanced penalties for the sale, distribution or large-scale electronic circulation of obscene objects, particularly those depicting minors, with the age threshold also being raised from 16 to 18. These amendments bring us in line with international standards and are crucial to allow us to respond to cases like the SG Nasi Lemak Telegram group, which saw thousands exposed to such harmful material. Importantly, the amendments make it clear that consensual and private sharing of intimate images between adults will not be criminalised, reaffirming the law's focus on protecting, but not policing citizens' private lives. While this is the case, I hope that people continue to be careful about who they share their intimate content with, especially in the face of potential love scams or even blackmail, amongst other possibilities for abuse or misuse. I would also like to suggest that such potential harms are addressed in sex education classes in schools. The amendments also seek to deal with the risks of synthetic, AI-generated intimate images, including \"deepfakes\" and computer-generated child abuse materials under our criminal laws. These images, though not constructed from real photographs, are equally harmful and can devastate reputations and cause emotional damage. The law must remain ahead of technology and this amendment sends a strong deterrent message to would-be offenders that \"virtual\" crimes are, in fact, very real, with equally real and painful penalties. It would also reinforce what our society considers to be obscene. While these are laudable steps, I would urge the Government to pay closer attention to bullying cases, in situations where it could entail the distribution of intimate images of minors, which can be weaponised as a form of sexualised bullying. While legal deterrence is very important, the penalties imposed on the perpetrators are by themselves not able to help support the recovery of the victims or to cope with the aftermath of the bullying attacks. Therefore, I hope that there will be clear guidelines and robust victim support systems to protect the vulnerable young victims. The Bill introduces stronger measures to deter harassment, doxxing and the making of false allegations against public servants, recognising the negative impact these acts have on public officers and, by extension, public confidence in our institutions. No longer must the victim prove harassment, alarm or distress. Intent to harass is enough and this is a much needed strengthening of deterrence without placing undue burden on the doxxing victim to prove that they had suffered. A new offence targets the disclosure of a public servant's identity accompanied by a falsehood, when intended to prevent or deter the discharge of their duties. This recognises that false narratives can rapidly undermine confidence in public institutions and make it difficult for public servants to perform their jobs. Finally, I support the revision of caning penalties, especially the landmark move to introduce caning for scams and scam-related offences. In the past five years, scams have shattered lives and torn families apart, with Singaporeans losing billions of dollars. This pain extends far beyond financial loss. Some victims feel so desperate that they resort to tragic ends. Families are broken by trust betrayed, and savings painstakingly built over lifetimes are wiped out in a moment. Mandatory caning for scammers and syndicate members, and discretionary caning for so-called \"mules\" will send an unequivocal signal  Singapore will not tolerate those who prey on our people, be it from behind a keyboard or through sophisticated networks. Deterrence must be robust and, as past experience with loan shark harassment shows, caning is effective in reducing recalcitrant crime. While the punishment is severe, the harm caused to victims, whose lives are often ruined, justifies the tough response. However, cross-border cooperation is still very important in the enforcement of these laws, in order to bring the criminals to justice. Sir, in Mandarin.

In today's context, whereby labour is globally mobile and the workplace has essentially become borderless, the competition between economies for jobs is now much more intense. It is now far harder to strike a balance between the needs and interests of employers and employees, especially for a small country with a globally-connected economy like Singapore. I am standing in support of this Bill because it is an important Bill that aligns Singapore's labour legislation with that of global peers and provides much-needed clarity for companies that choose to operate here. As a business-friendly environment, we have to understand that employers need clarity, flexibility and certainty so that they can continue to innovate and compete without undue fear of litigation or disruption. The Bill sends an important message  that discrimination has never been and will never be tolerated in our workplaces. Employees will have more certainty and confidence that decisions around hiring, promotion, training and termination will be based on merit. Those who believe they have been unfairly treated now have clearer and more accessible recourse avenues. The internal grievance process helps ensure that matters can be raised within the firm. The mediation-first approach means that disputes can be resolved in a less adversarial manner and allows for the possibility that some semblance of relationship can be preserved. This is also in line with what is commonly known as \"not burning bridges\". I hope that employers will view this new development positively and understand that the legislation is helping them to build stronger teams and healthier, more engaged workplaces. With the certainty offered by this piece of legislation, employers now have a clearer framework for setting up grievance mechanisms, conducting fair employment practices, understanding what constitutes adverse employment decisions. As the Bill prioritises internal resolution and mediation, employers have the opportunity to resolve disputes internally or at early stages rather than getting right into expensive, possibly protracted litigation. This helps preserve employer-employee relationships, maintain morale and reduce the risk of reputational damage. I wanted to just highlight some potential practicalities that may be faced by employees and employers as this is being rolled out. To realise the full potential of this Bill, we need to address the following issues. First, employees and jobseekers should be aware of their rights and the processes available to them and feel empowered to raise concerns without fear of retaliation. Employees may not be aware of their rights or may be unfamiliar with the process. Will the Ministry be planning to raise their awareness and educate them on the steps they need to take, such as keeping records and evidence of discriminatory practices? Sir, in Mandarin. (In Mandarin)  Employees and jobseekers should be aware of their rights and the processes available to them, and feel empowered to raise concerns without fear of retaliation. Employees may not be aware of their rights or may be unfamiliar with the process. Will the Ministry be planning to raise their awareness and educate them on the steps they need to take, such as keeping records and evidence of discriminatory practices? (In English)  Second, tripartite partners, unions, employer associations, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), TAFEP should continue their education and outreach to ensure that the transition is smooth and that smaller firms are supported. Third, employers should proactively review and strengthen their internal grievance handling procedures, provide training for managers and staff, and encourage a culture of openness and fairness. I know that this does not happen overnight, but it is in the interests of the company to do so. Fourth, I hope that the Government devotes some resources to monitor how the entire regime works in practice  examining the average time to resolution, cost to parties, outcomes and whether the mediation-first approach is achieving the harmony and fairness objectives intended. In addition, while the Bill aims to prevent abuse of the system, the safeguards for employers against unmerited claims could be a barrier to employees seeking redress. Some employees may be worried that they will have to go through a longer and more onerous process than simply sending a complaint to the authorities. What is the Ministry's assessment of this issue? I urge businesses to view this legislation as an opportunity, not simply as a compliance burden, but as a catalyst for better workplaces, where employees feel respected and empowered, where both sides can focus on what matters most and that is doing good work together."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

In terms of  the possible acquisition, further study needed to be done and the Government's final decision. My second question, I understand that one of the possible outcomes for 38 Oxley Road is to turn it into a heritage park. While we understand that further study and planning have yet to be conducted, would the Minister be able to share the following and I have got the following points. First, how this may look like? The second point is, if residents in the immediate vicinity be one of the parties who will be consulted, but I think just now Minister did mention that they will be consulted, so I thank Minister for that. My third point, Oxley is a very narrow road and there is a lot of illegal parking in the surrounding condominiums too.

To seize growth opportunities, MDDI will build capabilities, boost innovation and accelerate AI adoption in our enterprises and workforce. As AI tools become more accessible, MDDI will help enterprises, including small and medium-sized enterprises, deploy them to improve efficiency. We will support enterprises ready to go further in embedding AI into their core business processes to generate greater value. We will also anchor more AI Centres of Excellence to deepen their capabilities here. We will engage the Labour Movement, professional bodies, trade associations and chambers to develop suitable programmes to equip our workers with AI-related skills, and grow a core of AI-fluent workers who can be pacesetters in their fields. We will also work across the Government, with industry and the community to achieve scale in outreach. MDDI will continue to support individuals and households in accessing digital tools and services, and work with partners to promote inclusivity of digital services by design. We will also transform our libraries and archives to encourage reading, learning and discovery through offering physical and digital resources for all. MDDI will help Singaporeans stay safe online amid rising scams, cyberbullying and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks. The Government will continue to tackle scams on multiple fronts, including by deploying technical solutions for detection and prevention. We will set up the Online Safety Commission to support victims of online harms in seeking timely relief from perpetrators and platforms. To promote healthier digital interactions for children and youth, we will study interventions in other countries, build on existing measures for age-appropriate access and encourage positive norms for digital well-being. Public Service Media (PSM) and Government platforms remain essential for informed discourse that upholds public trust and social cohesion. MDDI will continue to support PSM entities by ensuring their financial sustainability, strengthening their verification capabilities, improving the prominence and discoverability of their products, and enhancing their ability to share Singapore’s perspectives internationally. MDDI will strengthen government communications across online and offline channels, ensuring their content remains timely, trusted and relevant to citizens. Through Reaching Everyone for Active Citizenry @ Home (REACH), we will deepen engagement and foster trust by bringing together people with diverse viewpoints. MDDI will raise our baseline cybersecurity standards nationally, including by promoting stronger cyber hygiene practices, particularly in entities that handle sensitive data or critical systems. We have strengthened incident reporting requirements for Critical Information Infrastructure owners to detect malicious cyber activities early, enabling timely responses. To meet growing demand for cybersecurity expertise, we will develop talent, innovation and the local research and development ecosystem. Resilient and future-ready infrastructure is essential for Singapore to thrive in a complex digital environment. MDDI will continue to invest in core digital infrastructure to ensure robust connectivity, and study areas such as 6G, non-terrestrial networks and frontier technologies like quantum to futureproof our networks. MDDI will lead whole-of-Government efforts to transform our digital systems and deliver more user-centric, secure and resilient digital services.

From 2021 to 2024, suspected APT attacks on Singapore increased more than fourfold. Such attacks happen across the private and public sectors, and various industries. Most recently, agencies detected UNC3886 attacking our critical information infrastructure (CII). Such attacks seriously threaten our national security. They can disrupt the delivery of essential services like electricity and water. Our sensitive data may also be stolen. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) works closely with both domestic and international partners and stakeholders to protect our nation's cyberspace against such threats. Within Singapore, CII owners play a critical role in safeguarding the critical systems under their charge. Under the Cybersecurity Act and Cybersecurity Code of Practice, CII owners must meet certain baseline requirements to help protect them from known vulnerabilities. These requirements are generally aligned to international best practices, such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 62443 series of standards for automation and control systems, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework for Industrial Control Systems. CII owners must also conduct regular cybersecurity testing and audits to verify the robustness of their defences. To raise awareness and prepare organisations for cyber threats, CSA conducts Exercise Cyber Star each year. This nationwide exercise tests critical sectors on their readiness to respond during a cyber crisis. International collaboration is also key to countering cyber threats, given the borderless nature of cyberspace. To this end, Singapore participates in regular CERT-to-CERT exchanges and joint cross-border operations, including with regional partners through the ASEAN Regional Computer Emergency Response Team. While we have the foundations laid, we cannot afford to be complacent. APTs are highly skilled and well-resourced. They are constantly testing their target' defences and finding new ways to achieve their objectives. Therefore, CSA is reviewing how we can work with relevant agencies and stakeholders to better protect our CII.

I have shared in my reply to Ms Tin Pei Ling's Adjournment Motion yesterday that libraries play a fundamental role as custodians of knowledge and serve as critical community institutions. Our libraries are key anchors for the community that must remain accessible. The revamp and relocation of libraries are in line with the National Library Board's (NLB's) Libraries of the Future (LOTF) Masterplan, a 15-year plan that charts the next phase of development for public libraries from 2017 to 2030. As part of this plan, NLB's strategy has been to move standalone libraries to locations which have easy access to transportation hubs and networks. These locations, which may include shopping malls and integrated hubs, provide convenience to library users and ensure that public libraries are accessible to as many residents as possible. By siting public libraries at convenient locations, at least 80% of the resident population stay within 15 minutes by public transport. The decision to relocate any library is not taken lightly. NLB does so in consultation with the relevant Government agencies and community partners. NLB takes into consideration various factors, such as land use plans, accessibility to major transport nodes, the number of residents it can best serve, the library's age, the number of years since the last major renovation and the suitability of the available space. Ultimately, NLB makes the decision based on how it can best serve and reach more patrons with its services and collections. NLB's experience has shown that these decisions have led to more people visiting libraries. Mall libraries receive about 30% more visitors per month on average than standalone libraries over a three-year period. The average monthly visitorship of a mall library is about 60,000. In contrast, the monthly average visitorship to Ang Mo Kio Library and Geylang East Library are only about 50-60% of that. Relocating Ang Mo Kio Library and Geylang East Library to nearby malls will enable NLB to serve more residents. The Government understands that public libraries hold social relevance and fond memories for many people. Apart from conserving Queenstown Library, NLB and the Urban Redevelopment Authority will work together with stakeholders on ways to celebrate the legacies of libraries that are relocated. This includes heritage interpretation in various forms, such as through digital documentation; physical markers, like storyboards, and sensitive urban design to retain a sense of place and character."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

For specific risks, there are also targeted interventions, for example, Elections (Integrity of Online Advertising) (Amendment) Act, and the upcoming Online Safety (Relief and Accountability) Bill. Human and organisational accountability is central to Singapore’s AI governance approach. The Government’s Model AI Governance Framework sets out guidelines for AI systems to be explainable, transparent and fair. Organisations deploying AI should establish clear governance structures with designated oversight roles. They should ensure meaningful human accountability in AI-augmented decision-making. Organisations should also implement risk management processes to monitor and mitigate risks, such as algorithmic bias. Agentic AI presents new opportunities and risks. These systems can execute actions, interact with external systems and adapt their behaviour with reduced human oversight. Our response focuses on two areas. First, we recognise that many risks arising from agentic AI are extensions of existing challenges. Existing guidelines and regulations, including risk management processes and oversight, apply to agentic AI systems. The principle of maintaining human accountability and putting in place sufficient controls and guardrails also applies. In addition, our long-standing efforts to strengthen data protection, cybersecurity and resilience help protect the systems that AI agents interact with. We are reviewing how to adapt and strengthen these frameworks and systems to account for the increased autonomy of agentic systems, while monitoring international developments in this emerging field. Second, we are developing capabilities to go beyond existing frameworks and approaches. We are running trials and experiments to stay abreast of the evolving technology and to understand what it takes to implement agentic systems responsibly. For example, the Government Technology Agency of Singapore has been experimenting with agentic AI in public sector use cases. We are doing this with care. This approach will deepen our understanding of how to interact with these systems, build confidence and harness their value for the public good."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

He is right that there is a need to support such local production initiatives and he mentioned a few examples that are now available on streaming services, such as Netflix, and soon to come, Tencent. These are very important to widening the reach of not just Mediacorp's productions, but also the productions of independent media content creators in Singapore. They both contribute to the vibrancy of our local ecosystem. In that regard, I am happy to share with him that it is not just the negotiations that are commercial in nature that take place between the production houses, including Mediacorp, and streaming services. These will, obviously, have to be carried forward with a view towards making sure that there is actually demand for the productions. Another very important way in which we are supporting this effort is through the International Co-Production Fund that the Infocomm Media Development Authority launched about two years ago. What this programme does is to provide funding support to the producers of local drama series to collaborate with their international counterparts, and their international counterparts will include scriptwriters, directors, producers. The reason we want to do so is to enable a reach into the wider pool of talents that are available but, more importantly, to create content that has potentially an audience beyond Singapore, even though the themes are very much anchored on Singapore. In this way, we also help the local production houses, including Mediacorp, reach an international audience and tell Singapore stories better. And I am pleased to share with him that since this fund was launched, in fact, there have been productions that have been provided with the support, and we will assess to what extent this kind of support can be sustained as well as expanded in the future."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

Over the past five financial years, the Government has allocated about $380 million annually to support Mediacorp to reach domestic audiences across four languages. This is lower than the annual funding of approximately $750 million allocated to the national broadcasters of Finland and Denmark, which have similar population sizes to Singapore. Mediacorp reached more than 90% of the local population through its owned and operated platforms as well as social media platforms. More than 75% of its audiences were satisfied with its services. We do not have comparable reach data in the earlier years as we have moved from tracking solely television (TV) reach to a broader reach metric across all Mediacorp's platforms and social media platforms. This is in keeping with the domestic audiences' changing consumption habits and Mediacorp's broader network strategy.

We can see that many victims add up to some very disturbing numbers. A Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI) study revealed that more than four in five had encountered harmful online content in the past year. This included content supporting illegal activities, sexual content and violent content. Many of these harms occur on platforms where people go for entertainment, such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. In addition to POHA, the Government has made several moves to enhance online safety. In 2022, we amended the Broadcasting Act to require social media services to disable access to egregious content, including content advocating suicide or self-harm. In 2023, we introduced the Code of Practice for Online Safety. Designated social media services were required to put in place systems and processes to enhance online safety, especially for children and youths. These laws have helped in some measure to stem the tide of online harms. However, they were not a panacea, nor could they be. The impact of technology evolves and is often understood only with time. We have therefore made it a point to review our laws regularly. Most recently, in January 2024, Parliament debated a Motion on Building an Inclusive and Safe Digital Society. The Motion and other Parliamentary Questions filed by MPs have contributed many useful ideas. They include calls by Mr Darryl David for victim-centric remediation; Ms Mariam Jaafar and Dr Wan Rizal for better platform accountability; Ms Tin Pei Ling, for more timely responses and respectful behaviours online; Ms Nadia Samdin, to lift the veil of online anonymity; Ms Hany Soh to address the use of deepfakes for extortion; Mr Yip Hon Weng, to firmly combat cyberbullying; and Mr Abdul Muhaimin, to deter hate speech. Mr Speaker, these calls by Members have reinforced where we can do more to strengthen protection for victims of online harms. They align closely with multiple studies conducted over the years by the Government, academics and non-government organisations. Let me share some important findings from these studies. The first important finding is that victims often want quick takedowns of online harms. A study by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) showed that platforms take about five days or more to act on valid reports of online harms. Many valid reports are not even acted on. This is highly unsatisfactory to victims. The second important finding is that victims are daunted by the existing channels for seeking remedies and in particular, they find court processes complex and expensive. The third important finding is that victims face difficulties seeking restitution. This is because they are often unable to confirm who was responsible for the harm. They continue to be in fear and cannot find closure. Today, we are taking a decisive step to introduce legislation. It will give victims of online harms an avenue of timely, effective and accessible redress. OSRA aims to do this in three ways. First, OSRA will establish the Office of the Commissioner of Online Safety. An agency, the Online Safety Commission (OSC), will be set up to support the Office of the Commissioner. OSC will be empowered to issue directions to communicators of harmful content, administrators of groups or pages and platforms. These directions require the recipients to act quickly on the harmful content. OSC will start by tackling online harms that are most prevalent and Singaporeans consider the most severe. Other harms will be dealt with progressively. The Minister of State Rahayu will elaborate on how OSC is intended to operate. Second, OSRA will introduce statutory torts. This is a major improvement. It provides a legal basis for the victim to take action. Most importantly, it will allow victims to initiate legal proceedings against those responsible for causing or continuing the harm. Sir, studies have shown that Singaporeans see online safety as a shared responsibility between technology companies, individuals, the Government, parents and schools. The proposed statutory torts will clarify the duties that users, administrators of groups and platforms owe to each other. It will significantly reduce ambiguity about what online behaviours are considered harmful and unlawful. Third, OSRA provides victims with the means to identify the person who caused the harm. Not all victims want this, but for those who do, OSRA plugs a gap. Minister Edwin Tong will elaborate on this. Sir, if Parliament passes OSRA, Singapore will be one of only a few countries worldwide to have an agency dedicated to helping victims of online harm. While we have few counterparts to learn from, this does not deter us. In setting up the OSC, we considered various models, such as mediation and dispute resolution. Victims are at the very heart of the OSC's mission. But the OSC's operational model and its oversight process are designed to be reasonable and fair to all. This is balanced against the need to act expeditiously and reduce the possibility of victim re-traumatisation. We also need to minimise long-drawn investigations and appeal cases. In designing our set-up for the Office of the Commissioner of Online Safety, we drew lessons from Australia's eSafety Commissioner. We learnt much from their generous sharing of experience to build a model that works for Singapore. For example, eSafety started small, focusing only on image-based child abuse material and cyberbullying of a child or young person under 18. To put OSC on a firm footing, we will, similarly, also start off by tackling the most severe and prevalent harms. Minister of State Rahayu will share more on the phased implementation approach. While we learnt important lessons from Australia's eSafety, I should point out, there are differences. For example, the Commissioner of Online Safety in Singapore will be empowered to deal with a wider set of harms. OSRA identifies thirteen types of harms which affect Singaporeans from all walks of life. The Commissioner can issue directions other than what is colloquially known as a \"takedown\". For instance, it can issue a Right-of-Reply Direction that will allow the offending content to be seen alongside the victim's reply. The Commissioner can also seek the platform's cooperation to obtain identity information of perpetrators. Sir, I cannot overstate the importance of the OSC being able to act swiftly and effectively. This victim-centric approach is the cornerstone of the OSC. After all, what Singaporeans have said they want most is a simple and effective way to protect themselves from online harms. Importantly, it sends a signal that harms to victims inevitably become harms to society. Our collective well-being is compromised when those who are harmed are denied restitution. With online harms becoming more prevalent, our barometer for acceptable online behaviour has been steadily eroded. But just as we would not tolerate harmful behaviours in the physical world, we also cannot allow bad behaviours to become normalised online. Through OSRA, we hope to avoid such an eventuality. In its place, we want to lay the foundations for our citizens' online interactions by fostering trust in online spaces, Singaporeans can participate safely and confidently in our digital society. Sir, we will continue to work with all our stakeholders from technology companies to community partners to implement OSRA. We continue to welcome Members' views on how we can further improve online safety for Singaporeans. Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to provide a summary in Mandarin, please? (In Mandarin)  Harmful content online has seriously affected our online environment and goes against our social values. The Online Safety (Relief and Accountability) Bill focuses on three main areas to strengthen online safety and protect Singaporeans from online harm. First, establishing the OSC will enable victims to receive help more quickly. When harmful content is encountered, the OSC can also issue directions requiring perpetrators or platforms to swiftly remove relevant content and stop its dissemination. This is precisely the outcome that most victims wish for. Second, the Bill also clearly lists out unlawful online behaviour, allowing victims to take civil action against the perpetrators and make perpetrators bear legal consequences for their actions. Finally, the OSC can help victims obtain the identity information of perpetrators. Although perpetrators often hide their identities, we are discussing with various platforms how to ensure that perpetrators cannot hide forever. Overall, the purpose of the Bill is not only to provide timely assistance to victims, but also to help them seek justice. We also hope the Bill can serve as a deterrent, set new norms for online behaviour and create a safer, more positive online space. (In English)  Sir, our journey towards building a safer online world does not stop with OSRA. We are especially concerned about younger persons and plan to do more to ensure the usage of online services is age-appropriate. We know anecdotally and from studies that youths can easily bypass age restrictions online. They use false birthdays, spam email accounts or borrowed credentials for verification. When one person figures out how to do so, they teach their friends, too. Such behaviours can cause more youths to be exposed to inappropriate content or persons. To moderate such risks, we have introduced age assurance measures on app stores. Hopefully, young users do not download age-inappropriate apps in the first place, but we know this is not enough. A more holistic approach is needed. This means extending age assurance requirements to social media services which attract many young users. We will explore better protections on other platforms, such as online games, where children and youths spend much of their time. In addition, we will look beyond content to address unwanted interactions and excessive time spent on apps. We will review the additional measures needed to better protect younger users online. As and when new technology arises, we will study them and update our safeguards, where required. Mr Speaker, let me conclude. In the debate to follow, I suggest Members keep in mind three points. One, OSRA introduces many new features in our online safety ecosystem. They are novel and meaningful. Nevertheless, there is much work ahead to ensure that these features can be effectively implemented. Two, OSRA is designed to help victims in areas and ways that matter most to them. This was how we determined the types of harms, range of directions and thresholds of harms. We have also introduced safeguards to prevent overreach of the Commissioner and OSRA. Three, these considerations should, therefore, inform further proposals and suggestions. We should be careful not to distract the Commissioner and the OSC, or impose more conditions which will impede victims from getting timely, effective and accessible relief. With that, Mr Speaker, I look forward to the debate on this Bill. Sir, I seek to move. [() Question proposed.

Unfortunately, we know of too many victims. In too many cases, we actually know the victims. We know their families and the pains they suffer. We know too that this is a very difficult problem. We want to take further action, but how? This Bill is our answer. While the Bill is new, Members' concerns are not. As far back as 2014, when the Protection from Harassment Bill was debated, Ms Tin Pei Ling asked about removing offensive content and identifying perpetrators online. In 2019, we amended the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) to cover online harassment. Members of Parliament (MPs), including Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Patrick Tay, and Minister of State Rahayu Mahzam, then a first-term MP, asked if victims would be given sufficient assistance when they approached the courts for help. In 2021, deep in the trenches of COVID-19, my Ministry set up the Sunlight Alliance for Action. It was a serious attempt to address online harms, especially those targeted at women and girls. Members like Senior Minister of State Sim Ann and Ms Hazlina Abdul Halim were actively involved. Sunlight shone a spotlight on the prevalence of online harms and their severe impact on victims. Arising from this effort, a new organisation, SG Her Empowerment (SHE) was born. Subsequent studies by SHE showed that two in five online harm survivors experienced at least one severe form of impact. These include serious emotional, mental or physical consequences like depression or self-harm. Three in four victims of online harms choose not to voice their opinions online for fear of being targeted if they did so. In 2022, Members debated the white paper on Singapore Women's Development. The Government made a clear commitment to tackle online harms. Many victims are women and girls, but men and boys have also suffered in silence.

Minister Edwin Tong and Minister of State Rahayu have responded to all of your comments comprehensively. Let me share just a few more observations about the overall thrust of the debate today. The first observation is that Members agree no one should be beyond accountability when their actions harm others. Ms Mariam Jaafar was most emphatic about it. The stories shared by Members today illustrate the mental toll that victims of online harms experience. They are visceral and emotional, and it is why it is so important to help victims get closure through restitution. It goes to the heart of the OSC's mission to provide timely, effective and accessible relief for victims of online harms. My second observation, Sir, is that Members recognise the complexity and tensions within the online sphere. Online interactions and the nuances of harmful activities can shift and evolve rapidly. No two cases of online harms will be the same. Every hour that passes by makes a difference to victims. This is why the OSC's work will be very challenging. Mr Xie Yao Quan posits that it will also be voluminous. The Government has explained how the OSC's processes strike a balance between speed and due process, efficiency and effectiveness. As much as possible, we will rely on clear criteria for action. We will also provide avenues for independent review of decisions so that outcomes are consistent and fair. Our framework will hold all stakeholders accountable – from platforms to perpetrators – for the safety of users. The OSC will not be undertaking this work alone. We have regularly worked together with our network of partners. Many have been on this journey with us since the beginning. The Bill, itself, has been years in the making. At every stage, local community organisations and advocates provided valuable insights that shaped our approach. Feedback from industry stakeholders further refined our framework. I am heartened they see Singapore as a determined, yet pragmatic regulator. I also hope they will continue to actively contribute to improving online safety. The OSC will draw upon the extensive experience and expertise of our partners. It is essential to how we navigate the evolving digital landscape. It will also help us improve our practices and stay responsive to victims' needs. My third observation is that Members agree the OSC must earn the trust of Singaporeans that it is effective and impartial. There are different thresholds for acting on online harmful activities that may occur. The Commissioner and the OSC have the delicate job of assessing reports and issuing directions on a case-by-case basis. We need to consider, for example, that what causes distress to a child may not be distressing to an adult. Mr Sharael Taha, Ms Eileen Chong, Ms Elysa Chen and Mr Alex Yeo have rightly pointed these out. We may adopt a victim-led approach to filing reports, but OSC will need clear guidelines, adequate oversight and accountability mechanisms. This is so that all parties, whether victims, alleged perpetrators, platforms and administrators know that the OSC makes its assessment based on objective criteria. The OSC's directions should only go so far to protect any immediate or further harm to victims. It should not be seen to be taking the side of one party over another. This is important, whether or not political personalities are involved. Trust in the OSC's objectivity and fairness will be critical to its success. Minister of State Rahayu has explained how the OSC will take an objective approach in assessing online harms. These thresholds are not met simply because someone says they feel offended by the content, no matter who that someone is. Clear definitions of each harm have been provided in the Bill, supported by explanatory notes and illustrations. Mr Alex Yeo and Mr Foo Cexiang acknowledged and agree with this approach. In time, the OSC will also publish guidelines on factors that it will consider in its decision making. This is important to aid public understanding. The transparency also ensures that the OSC's decisions can be held to clear standards. It is a necessary safeguard for fairness and consistency. I hope these assurances address Ms Chong's concerns on the independence of the Commissioner. To Mr Pritam Singh's question on the use of Ministerial Directions. I would like to assure him that there is no intent to issue directions to interfere in the day-to-day workings of the Commissioner in specific cases. An example of a type of direction that may be provided for is on resource prioritisation for the Office of the Commissioner of Online Safety. At this juncture, let me also thank Ms He Ting Ru for her proposed amendments to the Bill. Over the years, many Members of Parliament have given suggestions on strengthening online safety for Singaporeans. The Government has welcomed them. I spoke about this when I opened the debate. As with all well-intentioned suggestions, the Government's approach is to review them carefully and rationally. Minister of State Rahayu and Minister Edwin have comprehensively addressed why the amendments filed by Ms He are either already provided for in the Bill or could inadvertently limit the work of the OSC in providing relief for the victims. For instance, we agree that public interest is an important factor. In fact, the Bill provides that the Commissioner may consider it. But making public interest and overriding exemption could inadvertently provide a shield to bad online actors. Ms Tin Pei Ling underscored this risk. Under the pretext of public interest, these bad actors can continue to undermine victims' recourse. To be clear, the Government has no disagreement with the intent behind Ms He's amendments. We will also operationalise the law in the same spirit. But as with any law, we must strike a careful balance between being specific to make the law clear and operable, and being too specific as to inadvertently make the law less effective. MDDI and MinLaw have tried to get this balance right. OSC has both the latitude to act quickly and the duty to act responsibly within clear bounds. In designing the OSC's remit, we have taken every care to scope it precisely, proportionately and as practicably as we can, so that it fulfils its mission. OSC will learn from experience, continually refine its processes and always strive to do better. It will continue to monitor and report on its progress, refining the system openly as needed. We welcome the Workers' Party's (WP's) shared interest in ensuring that OSC is well-positioned to achieve its objectives. Our end goals are aligned. We all want better support for victims of online harms. I hope Members will agree that our priority is to allow OSC to focus on building its capabilities, clarifying its policies and cultivating its partnerships. It will take time and things may not work perfectly at first but, step by step, we will get it right. I thank Mr Singh for stating that the WP supports the Bill. If the WP agrees, I hope it will also consider withdrawing its amendments.

Interactions between big power contestation, digital connectivity, economic weaponisation and technological advances will introduce complex risks to our infrastructure, economy, and supply chains. Misinformation and the resultant polarisation of views could deepen societal fault lines and threaten our cohesion and stability. The National Security Coordination Secretariat (NSCS) adopts a whole-of-Government (WOG) approach to organise inter-agency work to identify, assess and mitigate national security risks spanning different domains. NSCS works with Government agencies to identify key emerging, cross-cutting security risks, assess the security implications of these risks on various domains as well as on interdependencies across these domains, and develop solutions and coordinate responses to address such risks. For example, rising digital connectivity could result in growing interdependencies across the economic and social domain, and the compromise of digital systems in an economic sector could have security consequences on other sectors. Inter-agency alignment and coordination are therefore critical in mitigating and tackling these complex and interdependent risks. As Singapore’s risks and vulnerabilities evolve, so must our national security capabilities to deal with them. NSCS supports efforts to strengthen the Public Service’s capability to organise itself to respond to risks in a proactive, agile, and well-coordinated manner. This capability building effort takes a WOG approach, covering not only operational and technological aspects, but also public education and communications. As we navigate an increasingly volatile and uncertain external environment, Singapore must remain proactive and well-coordinated in tackling cross-cutting and emerging risks to our national security. NSCS will continue to work closely with other Government agencies to achieve this mission."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

But the global security environment is increasingly volatile. Contestations between global powers and ongoing conflicts, such as those in the Middle East, have deepened geopolitical divisions, heightened the risks of racial and religious polarisation, and raised the threat of foreign interference. Terrorists and extremists have also exploited the conflicts to radicalise and recruit and incite violence. At the same time, transnational and cyber-enabled crimes continue to grow in scale and sophistication. Drug trafficking remains a huge concern, while scams and cybercrimes pose an unprecedented challenge to law enforcement. To respond to these threats, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will continue to strengthen our laws, deepen partnerships and harness technology aggressively. Singapore’s approach to criminal justice rests on three key thrusts  certainty of law, certainty of enforcement and certainty of punishment. Underpinning these is a set of laws that allows us to effectively deter, detect and enforce against crime. We will regularly review our laws to ensure that they remain fit-for-purpose, to deal with emerging threats and evolving criminal tactics. Later this year, we will introduce the Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, to further rationalise our criminal laws, better protect vulnerable victims and tackle emerging crime trends. We plan to amend the Road Traffic Act to deal with the worsening road safety situation and the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act to address evolving foreign interference tactics. We are also working on strengthening legislation to deal with challenges such as scams and drugs. MHA leverages partnerships to extend the Home Team’s effectiveness and impact. For example, to tackle the growing threat of youth self-radicalisation, the Internal Security Department and SGSecure Programme Office are working with the Ministry of Education to sensitise students and school staff to the terror threat, indicators of radicalisation and importance of early reporting. MHA is working closely with other agencies to counter increasingly permissive attitudes worldwide towards drugs, such as through strengthening preventive drug education initiatives. MHA will also support the Ministry of Health in tackling the growing threat of etomidate-laced vapes. To support the rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates and ex-offenders, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) and Yellow Ribbon Singapore will partner other Government agencies, employers and community organisations under the ambit of the Community Action for the Rehabilitation of Ex-Offenders (CARE) Network, which celebrated its 25th anniversary this year. Technology is critical to the Home Team. Working with the Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX), Home Team Departments will step up efforts to harness technology as a force multiplier. In particular, we are investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) and have launched a dedicated HTxAI movement to ramp up our capabilities. Technology investments have also improved the Home Team’s delivery of services to Singaporeans. The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority put in place automated gates, equipped with forgery detection and multi-modal biometrics screening systems, to allow for more secure border control while providing a seamless clearance experience. SPS is trialling an Autonomous Televisit System to make inmate visits more accessible to families, with secure identity verification through facial recognition technology. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) leverages drones and AI to support major security deployments. During the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2025, SPF and HTX used AI to analyse real-time drone footage, assess crowd sizes and improve operational responses. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) will be launching TruCerts, a blockchain-based system that enhances the tracking and verification of fire safety certificates for SCDF-regulated products and resolves compliance issues more quickly and accurately. The Central Narcotics Bureau’s (CNB's) Next-Generation Reporting Centre will streamline urine testing through automation, strengthening the robustness of the urine testing process, and reducing biohazard risks for CNB officers. Most importantly, MHA will continue to build and maintain public trust in the Home Team. In the 2024 Home Team Public Perception Survey, 93.1% of respondents said they personally trusted the Home Team, while 94.3% said they had confidence in the Home Team’s ability to keep Singapore safe and secure. With strong public trust, and by working together as One Home Team, we can confront emerging and evolving threats and keep Singapore safe and secure."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

That said, every fire is one too many. It causes major disruptions to those affected, and loss of assets and even lives. Even more unfortunate is the fact that most of the fires could have been prevented. One significant area of concern is the fire risk posed by Active Mobility Devices (AMDs). Over the last five years, 187 fires, or about 4% of fires in HDB estates, involved Active Mobility Devices (AMDs). Of these, about 46% involved Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs), 42% involved Power-Assisted Bicycles (PABs) and 12% involved Personal Mobility Aids (PMAs). About 98, or about half, of these AMD-related fires occurred during the charging of the devices. Although such fires form a small proportion of fires in HDB estates, AMD-related fires are typically more severe and more likely to result in fatalities and injuries. We are especially concerned about non-compliant AMDs. Just looking at the past three years, 77, or 72%, of the AMD-related fires in HDB estates involved PMDs and PABs which were either non-UL2272 compliant or non-EN15194 compliant, or had been modified, rendering them non-compliant. That is why the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has stepped up regulatory measures and enforcement against the sale or use of non-compliant AMDs. Since June 2021, businesses and individuals must obtain LTA's approval to import PABs and PMDs into Singapore. The devices must meet the prescribed technical and safety requirements, before they can be used on our public paths and roads. LTA also conducts regular enforcement operations against non-compliant AMDs on public paths, as well as retailers selling non-compliant AMDs. Between 2020 and 2024, LTA detected more than 6,000 cases of non-compliant AMDs on public paths and roads, and more than 100 violations by errant retailers. LTA, together with the relevant agencies, will continue to review existing guidelines on the safe storage and charging of AMDs. Currently, AMDs do not require special charging infrastructure and can be charged using standard wall sockets found in homes. We are considering tougher enforcement action to send a stronger deterrent signal that the use or sale of non-compliant AMDs poses significant safety risks. These individuals are knowingly endangering not just the lives of their family, but the lives of their neighbours as well. We have also been doing more to help homeowners better respond to fires. One way is to provide early warning whenever a fire breaks out. In 2018, we made it mandatory for all new residential premises to have Home Fire Alarm Devices (HFADs). This applies also to Community Care Apartments, which were all built after the regulation came into effect. For existing residential premises, we took a risk-calibrated approach and only mandated it for homes which are carrying out fire safety related addition and alteration works. This was to strike a balance in ensuring the adoption of fire safety equipment, but in a practical manner. theless, we strongly encourage all homeowners to install HFADs and have put in place several schemes to support certain groups in doing so. For HDB public rental flats, more than 80% of them already have HFADs installed and HDB will progressively install HFADs in the remaining 20%. The installation of HFADs is done at no charge to the tenants. In 2024, the Ministry of National Development (MND) expanded the Enhancement for Active Seniors programme to include the installation of HFADs. Seniors can enjoy a subsidy of up to 95% to install HFADs in their homes. HFADs are also installed as part of fire safety works, under the Home Improvement Programme, in cases where fire-rated doors are installed. As of June 2025, HFADs have been installed in about 191,000 HDB flats, or 17%, of all HDB flats. Of these, 74,000 flats, or 39%, were built prior to 2018. We will continue to review the fire safety of our HDB flats. However, we do not see a need for HFADs at HDB corridors, or for centralised building fire management systems, at this juncture. We have also implemented measures to better equip homeowners to respond to fires, by making fire extinguishers more widely and easily accessible. Since October 2023, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has progressively installed fire extinguishers at Lifesavers' Emergency Points, under a joint initiative with Temasek Foundation, HDB and Town Councils. The fire extinguishers are co-located with existing automated external defibrillators (AEDs) at the lift lobbies of one in every two residential HDB blocks. To date, more than 90% of all targeted HDB blocks have been equipped and we aim to complete the roll-out by 2028. At this juncture, we are focused on completing the roll-out to the remaining blocks. We will assess whether there is a need to do more thereafter. While the Government will continue to review our policies, programmes and regulations, the best defence against a home fire is the homeowner ourselves. SCDF continues to work with Government agencies, including LTA, HDB and the People's Association (PA), as well as other stakeholders, such as the Town Councils, and community partners, to strengthen public education and outreach on fire safety and emergency preparedness. Through the SCDF's Responders Plus Programme, residents are offered free hands-on training on the use of fire extinguishers, CPR and AEDs. In addition, the SCDF and the PA's Community Emergency and Engagement Committees will continue to conduct block evacuation exercises on a regular basis. With support from SCDF and PA, the National Fire Safety and Emergency Preparedness Council (NFEC) will launch a residential fire safety campaign, \"Better Awareness, Safer Homes\" to increase public awareness on the top causes of residential fires and encourage homeowners to evaluate potential home fire hazards. The Active Mobility Fire Safety Taskforce, co-chaired by LTA and SCDF, will also step-up public education under the \"Be Device-Safe\" programme, on the dangers of using non-compliant devices and the importance of safe charging. Fire safety is a collective responsibility. We must work together, each doing our part, to keep our homes fire-safe."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

She did not maintain a fixed place of stay, did not engage in any formal employment, did not have any local bank account and did not utilise any Government services, such as public healthcare, which would have required her identity to be authenticated. ICA is looking into the circumstances around her daughter's Permanent Residence (PR) application. We will take action if there was any fraud committed in the application or if other immigration offences, such as harbouring of overstayers, are disclosed. ICA will continue to try to improve its measures to detect and arrest overstayers."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

They accounted for about 28% of all scam cases and about 34% of all scam losses in the first half of 2025. To deal with GOIS, Government agencies have been using the \"gov.sg\" short message service (SMS) sender ID to send SMSes since July 2024 to help the public identify legitimate Government SMSes easily. We are planning a similar approach for outgoing Government calls. As an interim step, we intend to make outgoing calls to members of the public from commonly impersonated agencies, like the Singapore Police Force (SPF), to have only one common caller ID, regardless from which phone the officers are making the call. This will make it easier for the public to identify whether a call truly comes from the Police. The details will be announced in due course. In addition, we are working with online platforms to enhance safeguards against Government impersonation. We will issue an implementation directive under the Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA) to require Meta to put in place measures targeting scam advertisements, accounts, profiles and business pages impersonating key Government office holders on Facebook. We are also engaging online messaging platforms to implement measures to prevent the spoofing of \"gov.sg\" and public agency names. We have observed a rise in phishing scams as scammers have shifted their modus operandi to phishing banking or credit card credentials using fake advertisements on social media platforms. To address this, SPF requires online service providers designated under OCHA, such as Facebook and TikTok, to implement upstream measures, such as user verification, and to proactively detect and disrupt suspected scam activities. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has worked with the major retail banks to phase out the use of SMS One-Time Passwords for authentication of transactions for digital token users, and implement additional verification for provisioning of cards into mobile wallets. They are also working to roll out a Fast IDentity Online (FIDO)-compliant hardware token to better safeguard high-value Internet banking transfers. This will prevent scammers from being able to use just-phished banking credentials to steal the money in the account. But ultimately, a vigilant public is our best defence. Members of the public should check the authenticity of websites when making payments and be discerning when receiving communications claiming to be from the Government. Government officials will never ask you to transfer money or disclose bank log-in details over a phone call, to install mobile apps from unofficial app stores or purportedly transfer your call to the Police.

The Traffic Police (TP) has engaged lorry owners extensively through direct communications, industry engagements and public awareness campaigns. TP is also developing initiatives to incentivise vehicle owners to install speed limiters early. For example, drivers will be prioritised for Class 4 automatic transmission vehicle lessons if their employer has completed installing speed limiters on the company's lorry fleet. Other initiatives will be announced next month. Lorry owners who fail to comply will be liable for a fine of up to $1,000. Their vehicles will fail their regular mandatory inspection and be prohibited from being driven on our roads. The Government takes a multi-pronged approach to ensuring the safety of workers. First, reduce the need to transport workers, such as by facilitating the co-location of worker dormitories near to where they work, where feasible. Examples of such workplaces include shipyards and larger construction sites.

Nine had intentions to mount attacks in Singapore. All were self-radicalised online. The range of extremist ideologies and motivations that can radicalise an individual has become more diverse over the years. In recent times, ISD has issued ISA orders against four youths who were self-radicalised by far-right ideologies, and one who subscribed to a mix of extremist ideologies. where one's radical beliefs are reinforced through access to the copious amounts of extremist materials circulated in the spaces, and through interaction with other extremist or terrorist elements who are also in there. It can now take mere months, if not weeks, from the point where a youth encounters such online material, to the point of his or her radicalisation. The accelerated speed of radicalisation has meant shorter lead times for threat detection and intervention. The Government takes a multi-pronged approach to address the threat of youth radicalisation. Legislative levers have been strengthened through the introduction of the Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act and the Online Criminal Harms Act to block or remove harmful materials, including content that advocates violence and terrorism. Agencies, including ISD, leverage multiple touchpoints to sensitise youths and those who regularly interact with them, to the threat of radicalisation, and encourage early reporting of suspected radicalisation cases. For example, ISD has partnered with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to conduct counter-terrorism and counter-radicalisation workshops for educators, school counsellors, student welfare officers, and students. ISD and MOE have also jointly produced an online guide for parents and guardians on protecting their children from radicalisation. Community partners such as the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG) and the Interagency Aftercare Group (ACG) conduct regular outreach to youths through counter-ideology forums and school assembly talks, and visits to the RRG’s Resource and Counselling Centre. In schools, students learn about the negative impact of extreme ideas and prejudice on societies in Social Studies and History lessons. In Character and Citizenship Education, students learn to develop empathy and respect for others, recognise risks in the digital space, and use the internet safely and responsibly. They also develop critical skills to help them discern the reliability of information and learn to maintain vigilance against harmful online content. Beyond schools, the Government has put in place public education efforts to help Singaporeans navigate the digital space and safeguard against digital risks. As an example, the National Library Board's (NLB’s) S.U.R.E. (Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate) Programme, was launched in 2013 to strengthen Singaporeans’ resilience to misinformation and online falsehoods. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), as well as our community and religious organisations, such as Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS), has also leveraged the popularity of online platforms amongst youths. For instance, MHA launched the SGSecure Instagram and TikTok accounts in 2024 to share key advisories on radicalisation using bite-sized videos and posts. In 2019, MUIS launched the Muslim.SG website, which educates youths about Islam’s inherent values, and promotes messages of peace, tolerance, and compassion. MUIS has also worked with the Asatizah Youth Network, a group of young religious teachers, to provide guidance against youth radicalisation both online and in person."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

We conduct surveys to gauge public awareness of and sentiments towards the terror threat and the SGSecure movement, as well as the public's willingness and readiness to respond. These survey results are published annually in the Singapore Terrorism Threat Assessment Report. We also track the breadth and depth of direct citizen engagement in the SGSecure movement, for example, in schools, at workplaces and in neighbourhoods. For instance, we track the number of business entities engaged to raise their preparedness in dealing with security incidents, SGSecure programmes held in the neighbourhoods, households engaged on the movement, and students and educators engaged on counter-radicalisation. We are cognizant that these are imperfect measures of the effectiveness of the SGSecure movement. We will only know truly how successful the movement is when a terror attack strikes us. To better understand the say-do gap, between surveys and actual behaviour, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) conducted two social experiments in June 2025 using a suspicious suitcase and a suspicious vehicle, to gauge the actual level of public vigilance to terror threats. Only about 17%, or less than one in five, of persons who walked past the suspicious items noticed them. Among this 17%, only about 5%, or one in 20, intended or took steps to inform the authorities. This stands in stark contrast to the SGSecure Public Perception Survey held in 2024, which found that 77% of respondents said they were alert enough to look out for suspicious behaviour or items, and 88% said they would report such sightings. These results are of concern, even if understandable. With no terror attacks in recent memory, many Singaporeans wrongly assume that a terror attack is unlikely to occur. The strong capability of and high public trust in the security agencies also lead them to think that the Home Team will be able to prevent every attack. But the reality is, no security agency in the world can succeed in detecting and preventing every terror plot and attack. This is why the SGSecure movement has consistently emphasised that it is not a matter of \"if\" but \"when\" one takes place. To address the gap, MHA and our partner agencies will continue to explore new ways to make the threat of terrorism salient to Singaporeans. This includes continually refreshing our communications so that it remains relevant and compelling, and exploring new modes of engagement. For instance, MHA launched dedicated SGSecure Instagram and TikTok accounts in 2024 to better reach out to young Singaporeans and will refresh our campaign next year."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

On some issues, the younger people are more nationalistic and more Singaporean compared with older generations. And we find that younger Singaporeans are less prone to foreign influence, compared with some demographics in the older generation. So, there are these variances and what influences are working on them. Often, we find that these are influences from outside of Singapore.

In fact, if you look at my Ministerial Statement, one of the key points is that this Government's policies over the last 60 years have benefited the minorities  Malays, Indians and others. And that if we had followed the norms set in other places in the world, minorities would have been in a far worse position. So, it is entirely possible for a PAP politician to go and say the PAP is the best party to protect minority interest or protect Malay/Muslim interest, to protect Indian interest. It is perfectly possible to say that. And it is perfectly possible for someone to counter and say that is not correct. If you look at the Malay/Muslim community, it has been a long-standing commitment of the PAP government to support and uplift the Malay/Muslim community. It dates back to pre-Independence, to the days of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and successive Prime Ministers have reiterated this fundamental commitment. That is why our Constitution recognises the special position of Malays. It states that it shall be the responsibility of the Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster, promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interest, and the Malay language. So, it is entirely acceptable to say or contradict that one of the Government's key policies is the upliftment of the Malay/Muslim community. There is nothing wrong with advocating ways to advance a particular community or discussing legitimate community concerns. But when we advocate for the concerns of the Malay/Muslim community or any other community, we must ensure that our advocacy is conducted responsibly in a manner that upholds Singapore's unity. So, just as the Government's policies benefit the Malay/Muslim community, they must also benefit all other Singaporeans, and there is a distinction between advocating for the legitimate needs of a community versus pitting the different racial and religious groups against each other or calling on Singaporeans to vote along racial and religious lines. The latter is what causes division. Take Deros as an example. He is entitled to his opinions, ideas and suggestions, regardless of how absurd these were. But what was troubling was his call for Singaporean Malay/Muslims, to vote along racial and religious lines for specific candidates. As I said in my speech, if you go down this route, if you go down the route that Mr Damanhuri has advocated and Deros is advocating, who will benefit? The largest groups will be the ones that all political parties will cater to. Who will suffer? Not the Chinese. And that will be the road to Singapore's ruin. Because, ultimately, the Chinese will also suffer because we will not remain a country in the way we are. Everyone will suffer. So, when raising issues that relate to particular racial or religious community, the tone matters, the setting matters. We have to adopt a give-and-take approach. Avoid a zero-sum mentality. Avoid casting every issue as an ideological battle where no compromises can be made. Otherwise, we risk reducing our common space and inviting pushback from other communities. And never insult or belittle any racial or religious group, or attempt to pit certain groups against others."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

I will cover three areas in this Statement. First, the background to our approach to race, language and religion. Second, recent incidents where race and religion were brought into politics. And third, why if we go down this path, it will lead to bad outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans. Sir, let me begin by setting out the historical backdrop to our nation-building journey. After the Second World War, many former colonies became independent countries. Many had a dominant ethnic group. In some countries, this group made up an absolute majority. In other countries, the dominant ethnic group was the largest minority. Many of these countries chose the language of the dominant ethnic group to be the official language of their new nations. Sri Lanka and Malaysia are two examples. This is the approach of countries in the West as well, to organise themselves. In many countries in the West, as well as elsewhere, minorities who do not speak the official language are disadvantaged. Disadvantaged in education, employment and opportunities to progress economically and socially. Many countries also implemented policies which favoured the dominant ethnic group at the expense of and even suppression of the minorities. Sri Lanka is one example of this practice in the past. Many such practices and arguments over race, language and religion were quite common. Thus, in 1965 when Singapore became independent, whether you looked at Asia, Africa, Americas or Europe, the norm was that the language and culture of the majority would automatically become the language and culture of the state.

But what I would like is a more unequivocal acceptance of responsibility. If there is any asymmetry of information, it is that WP had all the information because neither the Government nor the PAP met with Mr Deros. I mean, however the meeting took place, Mr Deros met with five of the Member's candidates, including the Member's Vice Chairman. He said whatever he said. Until today, I do not know what was said. I only know what he reports as having been said and I know that nothing has been said by WP about what transpired other than that no promises, commitments or agreements were made. So, yes, there is an asymmetry of information – and that is, WP knows what happened; we do not. We only know what Deros has put up. And even with that asymmetry of information, knowing what we did, it strikes us and it seems to me to strike anyone, that this is not acceptable. And if it is not acceptable, for example Mr Singh issued a clear and unequivocal rejection of PAS' interference. He knew enough to say that he is, as Mr Low described him, \"a politician who understands politics\". He was able to do that after the Prime Minister called for a clear rejection. He never did that, and WP never did that about Deros. Let us just say that is why we waited for the elections to be over, emotions to come down, and we make the Statement. As I said, I was not going to go into this level of detail, we draw a line, we move forward as one Singapore. In future, if these things happen, the framework hopefully is clear enough, we all accept and move ahead. If you want the Government to tell you what to do and what not to do in the middle of the elections, the Government is also mindful of being seen to interfere with individual political parties. So, we need to be mindful of that, because it can be politicised. Maybe Mr Singh is welcoming of a phone call to say this is not on, but I can imagine a number of other political parties might say, you are trying to threaten me in the middle of a GE. So, we need to be very careful. So, the statements were clear, but carefully drafted. That is the MHA-ELD statement and the Prime Minister decided to come out and say it because this is fundamental for Singapore. So, how could it be any clearer? He said it. He said, reject this; reject identity politics, reject foreign interference. So, we did do it. If Mr Singh is talking about a specific reach-out to WP, we will think about it.

These settings encourage people to be rational, responsible, while pulling no punches on the substance of their views. This is, in broad terms, the first key policy underpinning our ideals. One, a robust legal framework that protects the rights of all communities and sets out what you cannot do, what you cannot say in public; and two, a reasonable, calibrated approach to discussing such views in public as well. But whilst laws can deter and penalise actions that seek to divide our society, laws alone cannot make society harmonious. They cannot force people to understand, respect and like each other across races, religions and across divides. That is where the second key policy framework comes in. This second key policy is that the Government should actively promote actions, platforms to encourage intermixing and understanding between our different communities. These are too numerous for me to cite. I have listed some of the key examples in Annex B. Members will see that there is a fair degree of activist Government policy. In the past, critics have mocked this as “social engineering” and a violation of free choice. But today, many look at our high level of social cohesion, and ask, “What is your secret sauce?” The Economist has in the past described the Singapore Government's approach as \"Dirigisme\". \"Dirigisme\" refers to a state-led approach to economic development. The word has negative connotations. But we make no apologies for our philosophy. It extends well beyond economic planning. The Government also takes an active stand and approach in managing social issues, housing issues, community issues and more. But for this approach, Singapore would not be where it is today.

I was not singling out any particular community. Our Malay/Muslim community during this GE was a victim of these tactics. They did not ask for these provocations nor did they support these tactics. They share the same strong commitment as any other community, to Singapore's multiracial, multi-religious approach. The Malay/Muslim community has stayed calm in spite of the deliberate attempts to rile up racial and religious sentiments among the community. This time, these people whom I have mentioned targeted the Malay/Muslim community. Previously in other GEs, the Chinese community has been targeted. Those who play identity politics do not just target one community. In fact, one thrust of my speech is that if we go down this road of identity politics, everyone will be targeting the Chinese community for obvious reasons. So, after the statement by the Government was issued, MHA and ELD and the Prime Minister's press conference, many members of the Malay/Muslim communities spoke up to affirm their support for a multiracial Singapore. In every society there will be an attempt to draw invidious comparisons to mobilise different communities. As I have said in my Ministerial Statement, we have seen this in many countries and that is what was being tried in this GE – to divide Singaporeans. The attempts included the attempts by PAS. And we can see how societies are getting increasingly divided. So, let us continue to stay firm to our principles and avoid the pull of identity politics.

During the elections, the Government issued a statement through MHA and ELD. The Prime Minister spoke as Prime Minister, the highest level of intervention. And he said what our principles ought to be, and he set out and asked political parties to make clear their position. And that had some impact. After that, the President's speech mentioned it, the importance. Then, the Prime Minister again spoke during the Debate on the President's speech. As I said in my Ministerial Statement, why are we repeating this over and over again? Because it is fundamental. Without an agreement on this basic point, Singapore will not survive. It is existential. Which is why I have pitched my speech as one that I hope all sides can agree on, as Singaporeans, and learn from, for the future. That is very important – how do we deal with such incidents in future? I think responsibility means doing that well. After the Prime Minister's intervention in the Debate on President's speech, this is the earliest opportunity. This is an important issue. This is the earliest opportunity. We decided that it should be dealt with in Parliament. And I am speaking in Parliament at the earliest possible opportunity. So, that answers \"why now?\" On the incident relating to pork, the items of meat being sent to various mosques, the matter is under investigation. Members know that somebody has been charged. Members would have heard me say that we take this very seriously; it is not acceptable. And we will deal with it very stiffly in terms of the charging position that we take and decisions that are taken from the Government side. Then, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) will have to independently look at it. And what happens in Court, that is for the Courts to decide. But I am not speaking today because of the incidents relating to the mosque, just in case Members get that impression. The sequence for my speech today is, as I have said  after the President's speech, this is the first occasion. And it is a speech that seeks to set out the framework and fundamentals – first, to remind ourselves; and second, to guide us for the future, for all political parties, so that we accept what is precious in Singapore and we say we will protect it. On safe spaces for minorities or for anyone, really, I mentioned it in my speech. There are various fora, there are young people, unions, other associations, grassroots, a variety of formats where these issues can be raised. Safe spaces. Nobody pulls punches on the substance of things, but they are respectful of each other. Beyond that, if people want to organise fora on their own, they are welcome to do so and discuss these issues. All we ask is  first of all, do not attack other religions or races, because that will breach the law and we will enforce the law. Two, be respectful and take the approach of \"give and take\". Because if you push with only your views, then others too, will push with only their views. Remember that we are in a multiracial, multi-religious society, so approach it with common sense and give and take. And within that framework, it does not mean that you must accept discrimination, you must accept racism. You are entitled to bring it up. And in fact, recently, legislation has been put in place that protects minorities and others from having their employment terminated for the wrong reasons, including that of race or religion. So, the Government will continue doing it in terms of protecting everyone, in trying to create a bigger common space. It is also individual responsibility. But my speech should not be understood as saying, \"Oh, you cannot speak about race or religion or discrimination or racism\". The way to deal with those is to speak about it, but do so, have a care, do so sensibly."}], "max_tokens": 3000, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Positions": {"type": "string", "description": "A list of policy positions expressed by the speaker from this speech.

Sir, let us keep the two separate. On Deros, I think listening to Mr Singh, he agrees that it should have been and could have been clearer. And let us just remember the person meeting Deros was the Vice Chairman of the party, a CEC member, a very senior leader, he was meeting Deros together with all the WP Malay candidates. So, let us just take responsibility for it and agree that the statement that came out was not unequivocal. It should have been clearer. And I think Mr Singh agrees that it should have been clearer. There should have a clear rejection of Deros' demands. There should have been a rejection of Deros' support for WP's Malay candidates. There should have been a rejection of his support for Mr Faizal Manap. It was not done immediately and when it was done, it was done without a clear rejection. What did we learn from this? Based on what Mr Singh agrees, in future, we need to be very aware and we need to be clear when we make our rejections. So, I thank him for that. The Government should be more active, I think is Mr Singh's second point. I think we all have to work on this together, but that can only come about if we all agree on the fundamentals. The Government issued the statement, MHA. The Prime Minister made an extraordinary move because it was so important, and he came out and spoke in public during the GE, and said this is not acceptable. And I think that then prodded WP into making clear statements on PAS but not so much on Deros. On the relationship between the PAP and PAS, Sir, there are a number of political parties in Singapore  PAP, WP, SDP, the Progress Singapore Party. Mr Singh knows that they all have interactions with various political parties around the world. So, let us not seek to confuse these issues. This is not an attempt to try and confuse the public. The PAP can reach out to a whole variety of parties including PAS and the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), and around the region in Indonesia and other places. That is part and parcel of understanding what is going on around the world. That is very different from accepting a foreign endorsement of our candidates. If PAS had endorsed the PAP candidates of any race, I think this House, knowing as it does our philosophy, can be sure that we will have rejected it immediately. So, let us not confuse these issues. Let us stick to what we are talking about here. One is Deros' endorsement of WPs' Malay candidates, leading clearly into an identity politics situation; and the other, PAS' endorsement of WPs' Malay/Muslim candidates.

The first is on Deros. And in my Statement, I said that the WP statement did not reject Deros' very serious conduct in asking Muslims here to support the WP on racial and religious grounds, and asking voters in Tampines to vote for Mr Faisal Manap. I hope after the Statement we can at least have common ground that what Deros did was unacceptable. And if there is common ground that that was unacceptable, then it should have been responded to immediately. And it should have been an unequivocal rejection of what Deros said. Second is foreign influence. I said that the initial statement by WP was not clear, but it got clearer when Mr Singh gave his doorstop, and then, it became quite clear after the Prime Minister had specifically called on political parties to make their position clear. Mr Singh then clearly, unequivocally, rejected PAS' statements during the rally. So, on I did not say that either Mr Singh or the WP had made their position clear on Deros, it should have been made clear. I am not quite sure why there is a reference to the POFMA office or MHA or the Government, or this suggestion of should the Government have communicated with a political party in the middle of the GE. Look, we are now here talking about Deros' meeting with the WP's Malay candidates. According to Deros, he met with all of the WP's Malay candidates. That means Mr Faisal Manap and four others. Assume that was known, Deros put up his posts on 23 and 24 April, Nomination Day and the second day. Deros talked about his meeting with the WP. He talked about his demands. He said he would canvas support for the WP, if the WP agreed to his demands and said that people should vote for Mr Faisal Manap, and this was after meeting Mr Faisal Manap and the WP's Malay candidates. Mr Faisal Manap was and is the Vice Chairman of the WP and, if I am not wrong, probably a Central Executive Committee (CEC) member as well. Mr Faisal Manap and others need the POFMA office to tell them about their meeting with Deros and his posts? Then, there is a larger point, a more substantive point, which I have alluded to. The statement was issued on 26 April, the WP statement. As I said earlier, it did not reject Deros' position that he would ask Muslims in Singapore to vote along racial and religious lines, nor did it reject Deros' support for its anchor in Tampines, Mr Faisal Manap. Instead, what it said is that no commitments, promises or agreements had been made to Deros. That is something that you might find lawyers drafting for each other. You do not see that in political statements, which ought to be clear and unequivocal. And I think Mr Singh, if I heard him correctly, conceded that the statement could have been clearer, and I thank him for that. So, it should have been squarely stated that we are rejecting all of this. When there is no clear response, it raises questions. And if you look at it logically, do we agree that what Deros said was serious? Obviously, yes. I think all of us, regardless of party affiliation, would agree to that. Do we agree that it required a clear and immediate rejection without any qualification and it was important to do so? Listening to Mr Singh just now, I think he accepts that. Can the lack of a clear rejection of Deros' statement be an oversight? Look, Mr Low Thia Khiang has described Mr Singh as \"a good politician\", meaning a politician who understands politics. Mr Low said this last year. So, the lack of clear response, a vague response must have been a deliberate choice based on a calculation of interests. I am just taking it point by point, as a series of logical conclusions, that there is some benefit in keeping it less clear and that Deros can swing some votes. Those who understand politics will know this. This is not rocket science. That sort of calculation may bring some short-term benefits. And whatever I say about Deros also goes for PAS. But as I said, long-term damage to our country. It goes against our National Pledge, it goes against our multiracial ideals. So, being true to our pledge has to go beyond citing it during GE rallies. It must mean putting it in practice even when it is difficult to do so. Sincere belief requires acting true to the words of the pledge, even when it may cost some votes. So, I will not go into any of this detail. I refrain from saying all of this bluntly in my speech. The main purpose of my speech was to say, let us come together, keep faith with our fundamentals of multiracialism and not play identity politics. My hope and the purpose of my speech is that we will learn from what had happened, move forward as one people, Singaporeans together, agreed on the fundamentals; close ranks when people like Deros and foreign parties like PAS try to divide us and say and agree that we will reject such attempts immediately and clearly, even if we may calculate them to be in our short-term political interest. Let us just be clear today, we do not need to refer to the POFMA office, we do not need to refer to the Government or say the Government did not tell us. It is really what each of us is responsible for and what responsible conduct means. When your Vice Chairman is meeting together with the slate of candidates and there are these demands, you do not need to be told by the Government, really.

In the 2024 Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) Survey on race, religion and language, 65% of Singaporeans rated racial and religious harmony as high or very high. More than 90% felt that there was sufficient involvement, or that there should be more Government involvement to ensure racial and religious harmony. Over the past five years, there have been 178 Police reports filed relating to race and religion. This works out to only about three cases per 100,000 people per annum. Sir, I am not suggesting that race and religious harmony is perfect in Singapore. As I said earlier, it is work-in-progress. Members of different communities do experience racism and face other issues. The deep-seated human instinct, the tribal emotions which come from the gut, these cannot be wished away. As the Prime Minister himself has acknowledged, it is more difficult to be a member of a minority community in Singapore than being a member of the majority communities. But as a system, we have sought to contain and overcome the natural human impulses by overlaying them with a broader sense of national identity. A community of shared values, experiences and vocabulary. And in the words in our pledge, \"regardless of race, language or religion\", our approach towards racial and religious issues is not to forsake our respective races, languages or religions and force a singular identity, but to forge common ground and find strength in diversity. And our people generally accept these principles. Singapore is in a good position today. Not perfect, but I dare say, better than most other places. Many of these places started out better and stronger than us, but many of them have been going the wrong way. Sir, this deals with the first part, the background to our approach to race and religion. Let me move on to the second part. Second point, some recent incidents where race and religion have been brought into politics. The good position we have in Singapore can remain so only if Singaporeans work at keeping it that way. Politicians, in particular, play an important role in setting the right tone for our society. Not deepening divisions, not misleading the different communities, but by encouraging constructive discussions. By finding solutions to problems and issues faced by the different ethnic communities, not by exacerbating them and not by sharpening differences. It is possible for politicians to say that they subscribe to our multiracial and multi-religious values, but still use veiled rhetoric to work up racial and religious sentiment. Sir, if you look at our short history over 60 years, there have been several attempts to inflame racial and religious sentiments for political gain.

Are we colonised in our mind so much that we have to continue to hark back to these theories which have failed all around the world? What has happened in the US? What has happened in the UK, where they have all these fora that the Member has refer to? What has happened in France? What has happened in Germany? Go look at the statistics. The far right in Germany is getting into power. The far right in France is now getting into power, too. Because when you allow such free-flowing expressions without any kind of legal framework, what is going to happen? Identity politics. What will be the identity politics in Singapore? I am Chinese, you are Chinese. Vote for me. Why do you want to vote for that Malay or that Indian? So, you have the GRC systems. You have the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act. Why do not we look at what we have and objectively ask, is it better than what is there elsewhere? That is our first question. Is our situation better than what you see in the US, in Europe and in many Asian countries? Yes? No? If the answer is yes, what has worked. Something has worked. I have listed the things that have worked. Is it perfect? No. I said it is work-in-progress. Perhaps, it will always be work-in-progress because of the deep-seated human emotions.

I think that is something that should be looked at. But the answer then is not to jump immediately to models which have failed miserably everywhere else. The answer is to say, how do we reach these people. How do we get them to come and talk? These so-called curated fora, all it means is, a safe place is created, different people with different views come together. Moderators come in. They discuss. It is hard-hitting, and it is on substance. Nobody pulls their punches, but they are respectful.

If our founding fathers had followed the prevailing norm, Mandarin would have been our only official language. But we became independent in 1965 precisely because Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team decided on a very different approach for Singapore. Mr Lee Kuan Yew declared on the day of our Independence  “This is not a Malay nation; this is not a Chinese nation; this is not an Indian nation. Everyone will have his place, equal  language, culture and religion.” This was not just political rhetoric. Our founding fathers took systematic steps to build a multiracial, multi-religious Singapore. They enshrined the foundational principles  unity in diversity, justice and equality in our National Pledge. All citizens, regardless of race, language, or religion were to have equal status. Policies were designed to enable each ethnic group to preserve its own cultural heritage. At the same time, our common space would be enlarged to facilitate interaction and understanding between the ethnic groups. English was used as the language of administration and instruction, meaning the language used in schools. At the same time, students studied their mother tongues – Mandarin, Malay, Tamil – as a second language. Selected festivals of the major ethnicities were designated as public holidays. And on the ground in the heartlands, activities were organised for all ethnicities to promote multiracial harmony. Religious freedoms were protected in the Constitution. At the same time, we retained Malay as our national language. This meant that we continued singing our national anthem Majulah Singapura proudly in Malay in schools and at national events. Members can see how different this approach is compared with the approach taken by most countries. We did not force any ethnic group to assimilate. The majority group accepted that while they were the biggest group, they should nevertheless take extra care and make sure that the minorities were not slighted. It was in this spirit of multicultural integration that we encouraged each ethnic group to preserve its own heritage. And we created space, space to enhance mutual understanding and develop a common identity. Our founding fathers, however, faced tremendous opposition to this approach. Many Chinese organisations, including some highly influential ones, asked the Government to make Mandarin our national language and the only official language. Questions were asked  why not – since Chinese were 77% of the population? Why should Singapore adopt English, the colonial master's language, as the language of administration and instruction? Why should Malay be the national language? Why should our National Anthem be in Malay? Barisan Sosialis, the main opposition party then, took an active position on this matter. The communist-inspired left had long relied in Singapore and Malaya on the mobilisation of Chinese-educated students and labour organisations. They did this by emphasising Chinese-language, Chinese-culture and Chinese education. By doing this, they repeatedly stoked tensions within the Chinese community. The politically expedient course for the People's Action Party (PAP) government would have been to agree to these demands and make Mandarin Singapore's only official language. It would have helped to anchor the support of the majority Chinese community. In the run-up to the 1963 General Election (GE), the PAP government's majority had been steadily whittled down. Their foothold in Parliament had been eroded to just 25 out of 51 seats at the time of the 1963 GE, less than half. The PAP's position did improve after the 1963 GE, but it was still in a fierce contest with the Barisan Sosialis. Yet, it chose to follow the more difficult, more idealistic course, at a time when the PAP government needed the support of the majority Chinese population. Mr Lee and his colleagues chose the path that would in most contexts be seen as politically foolhardy. I would ask Members to take a moment to reflect, think about this. You will realise how extraordinary their actions were. How this cuts against all political realities and standard norms. And for 60 years, we have strived to achieve the ideals in our pledge. But achieving the ideals is still work-in-progress. We have not fully achieved them. Minorities in particular will tell you about the lived realities on the ground. That they sometimes face racism at different levels. That they sometimes feel discriminated against. Beyond what each of us hears, surveys show how minorities feel. Some Chinese will also tell you of their experiences, though the instances are much fewer. The key point however is  we set out those principles as our ideals and we swam strongly against the tide – the tide of ethnic identity as an organising principle of society. Instead, our foundational principles were a secular state, meritocracy, multiracialism, equal opportunities for all and the rule of law. A secular state, with neutral language, English, as the language of administration and instruction. The language of government, business, education. Mr Lee explained this in this House in the year 2004  if Chinese had been made the working language in 1965, and I quote, “Singapore would fall apart. Our races would be in conflict.” And over the last 60 years, we have taken various steps to achieve the ideals in our pledge. In this context, I will mention two key policies. These were put in place to make the ideals our reality. The first policy, it was decided that a strong legal framework was necessary to preserve our communal harmony and minimise racial, religious conflict. One of the first Constitutional amendments after independence established the Presidential Council for Minority Rights. The Council's function is to assess whether any legislation would create a differentiating measure which would disadvantage any racial or religious group more than others. The Council's report would then be tabled in Parliament. Laws were also passed to set out what conduct, what speech would not be allowed relating to race, religion. And over time we have been strengthening, modernising these laws. We have for example, the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act, Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act. These laws set out the ways in which we can deal with threats to racial and religious harmony. These laws take their inspiration from earlier legislation. They are only two among a whole framework of laws which seek to preserve our racial and religious space, and deal firmly with attacks on race, religion. For example, we disallow hate speech and offensive speech, against races and religions. Sir, these points have been addressed many times. However, some Members may not be aware of them. So, for their benefit, I have set out a background summary on some of these points.

Do not expand acronyms, just leave them as they are.\n\n3. Output should be a bullet list with '-' used as the bullet.\n\n4. State the policy position directly rather than use action words. For example, 'Emphasize the importance of supporting youths financially' should simply be 'support youths financially'. Remember that the output is not a summary of the speech but a list of policy positions.\n"}, "Topic": {"type": "string", "description": "The topic of the speech chosen ONLY from one from these topics: [Education, Urban Planning, Public Health, Communications and Technology, Housing Policy, Family and Social Welfare, Transport, Art and Culture, Law and Justice, Environment and Climate, Sport, Foreign policy, Military Defense and National Security, Economic Development and Trade, Labour, Budget and Taxation]. \n"}}, "required": ["Positions", "Topic"], "additionalProperties": false}}}}}
