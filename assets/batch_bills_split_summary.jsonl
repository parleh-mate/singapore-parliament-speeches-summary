When the liquidator —\n\n (a) has realised all the property of the company, or so much of 25 the property of the company as can in the liquidator’s opinion be realised, without needlessly protracting the liquidation, and has distributed a final dividend, if any, to the creditors and adjusted the rights of the contributories\n among themselves and made a final return, if any, to the 30 contributories; or\n\n (b) has resigned or has been removed from office,\n\n\n-----\n\n176\n\n## the liquidator may apply to the Court —\n\n (c) for an order that the liquidator be released; or\n\n (d) for an order that the liquidator be released and that the company be dissolved.\n\n5 Final account and dissolution\n\n## 148.—(1) Before a liquidator makes an application to the Court under section 147, the liquidator must call a meeting of the company and the creditors for the purpose of laying before them an account showing how the winding up has been conducted and the property of\n\n10 the company has been disposed of and giving any explanation of the\n## account.\n\n (2) The meeting must be called by an advertisement, published in the Gazette and at least one English local daily newspaper —\n\n (a) which must specify the time, place and object of the\n\n15 meeting;\n\n## (b) which must be published at least 30 days before the meeting;

and\n\n (b) if they so require, who are to be members of the committee.\n\n (2) If there is a difference between the determinations of the\n\n20 meetings of the creditors and contributories, the Court is to decide the\n## difference and may make such order as the Court thinks fit.\n\n Constitution and proceedings of committee of inspection\n\n 151.—(1) The committee of inspection must consist of creditors and contributories of the company, or persons holding —\n\n25 (a) general powers of attorney from creditors or contributories;\n## or\n\n (b) special authorities from creditors or contributories authorising the persons named in those special authorities to act on such a committee,\n\n30 being creditors, contributories or persons (as the case may be)\n## appointed by the meetings of creditors and contributories in such\n\n\n-----\n\n179\n\n## proportions as are agreed or, in case of difference, as are determined by the Court.\n\n (2) The committee of inspection may meet at such times and places as it may from time to time appoint, and the liquidator or any member\n of the committee may also call a meeting of the committee as he or she 5 thinks necessary.\n\n (3) The committee of inspection may act by a majority of its members present at a meeting, but must not act unless a majority of the committee is present.\n\n (4) A member of the committee of inspection may resign by notice 10 in writing signed by him or her and delivered to the liquidator.\n\n (5) The office of a member of the committee of inspection becomes vacant if —\n\n (a) the member becomes bankrupt;\n\n (b) the member assigns his or her estate for the benefit of his or 15 her creditors;\n\n (c) the member makes an arrangement with his or her creditors under this Act; or\n\n (d) the member is absent from 5 consecutive meetings of the\n committee without the leave of the other members of the 20 committee who represent the creditors (where the member represents creditors) or the contributories (where the member represents contributories).\n\n (6) A member of the committee of inspection may be removed by an\n ordinary resolution at a meeting of creditors (where the member 25 represents creditors), or of contributories (where the member represents contributories), if notice of the meeting has been given at least 7 days before the date of the meeting, stating the object of the meeting.\n\n (7) A vacancy in the committee of inspection may be filled by the 30 appointment by the committee of the same or another creditor or contributory or person holding a general power of attorney or special authority as specified in subsection (1).\n\n\n-----\n\n180\n\n## (8) The liquidator may at any time of the liquidator’s own motion, and must within 7 days after the request in writing of a creditor or contributory, summon a meeting of creditors or of contributories, as the case requires, to consider any appointment made under\n\n5 subsection (7), and the meeting may confirm the appointment or\n## revoke the appointment and appoint another creditor or contributory or person holding a general power of attorney or special authority as specified in subsection (1), as the case requires, in place of the person appointed under subsection (7).\n\n10 (9) The continuing members of the committee of inspection, if not\n## less than 2, may act despite any vacancy in the committee.\n\n (10) In this section, “general power of attorney” includes a lasting power of attorney registered under the Mental Capacity Act (Cap. 177A).\n\n15 Subdivision (4) — General powers of Court\n\n## Settlement of list of contributories and application of assets\n\n 152.—(1) As soon as possible after making a winding up order, the Court must settle a list of contributories and cause the assets of the company to be collected and applied in discharge of the liabilities of\n\n20 the company.\n\n## (2) After making a winding up order, the Court may rectify the register of members in all cases where rectification is required under this Part.\n\n (3) Despite subsection (1), where it appears to the Court that it is not\n\n25 necessary to make calls on or adjust the rights of contributories, the\n## Court may dispense with the settlement of a list of contributories.\n\n (4) In settling the list of contributories, the Court must distinguish between persons who are contributories in their own right and persons who are contributories by reason of being representatives of others, or\n\n30 by reason of being liable for the debts of others.\n\n## (5) The list of contributories, when settled, is prima facie evidence of the liabilities of the persons named in the list as contributories.\n\n\n-----\n\n181\n\n## Payment of debts due by contributory and extent to which set‑off allowed, etc.\n\n 153.—(1) The Court may make an order directing any contributory (for the time being on the list of contributories) to pay to the company,\n in the manner directed by the order, any money due from the 5 contributory or from the estate of the person whom the contributory represents, exclusive of any money payable by the contributory or that estate by virtue of any call under this Act or the Companies Act, and may —\n\n (a) in the case of an unlimited company, allow the contributory 10 to set off any money due to the contributory, or to the estate that the contributory represents, from the company on any independent dealing or contract, but not any money due to the contributory as a member of the company in respect of\n any dividend or profit; 15\n\n (b) in the case of a limited company, make to any director whose liability is unlimited, or to the estate of that director, the like allowance; and\n\n (c) in the case of any company, whether limited or unlimited,\n when all the creditors are paid in full, allow a contributory 20 to set off any money due on any account to the contributory from the company against any subsequent call.\n\n (2) The Court may, either before or after it has ascertained the sufficiency of the assets of the company —\n\n (a) make calls on all or any of the contributories (for the time 25 being on the list of contributories), to the extent of their liability, for payment of any money which the Court considers necessary —\n\n (i) to satisfy the debts and liabilities of the company and\n the costs, charges and expenses of winding up; and 30\n\n (ii) for the adjustment of the rights of the contributories among themselves; and\n\n (b) make an order for payment of any calls so made,\n\n\n-----\n\n182\n\n## and, in making a call, may take into consideration the probability that some of the contributories may partly or wholly fail to pay the call.\n\n (3) The Court may order any contributory, purchaser or other person from whom money is due to the company to pay the amount due into a\n\n5 bank, named in the order, to the account of the liquidator, instead of to\n## the liquidator, and any such order may be enforced in the same manner as if the Court had directed payment to the liquidator.\n\n (4) All moneys and securities paid or delivered into any bank under this Division are subject in all respects to orders of the Court.\n\n10 (5) An order made by the Court under this section is, subject to any\n## right of appeal, conclusive evidence that the money (if any) appearing under the order to be due or ordered to be paid is due, and all other pertinent matters stated in the order are taken to be truly stated as against all persons and in all proceedings.\n\n15 Appointment of special manager\n\n## 154.—(1) The liquidator may apply to the Court to appoint a special manager of the estate or business of a company (called in this section a special manager), if the liquidator is satisfied that the nature of the estate or business of the company, or the interests of the creditors or\n\n20 contributories generally, require the appointment of a special manager\n## other than the liquidator.\n\n (2) The Court may appoint a special manager to act during such time as the Court directs with such powers, including any of the powers of a receiver or manager, as are entrusted to the special manager by the\n\n25 Court.\n\n## (3) A special manager —\n\n (a) must give such security and account in such manner as the Court directs;\n\n (b) is to receive such remuneration as is fixed by the Court;\n\n30 (c) may at any time resign after giving not less than one\n## month’s notice in writing to the liquidator of the special manager’s intention to resign;

The Court may make such order for inspection of the books\n and papers of the company by creditors and contributories as the Court 15 thinks just, and any books and papers in the possession of the company may be inspected by creditors or contributories accordingly, but not further or otherwise.\n\n Power to arrest absconding contributory, director or former\n director 20\n\n 157.

of any money or property by any officer of the company during the\n\n10 2 years preceding the commencement of the judicial management or\n## winding up (as the case may be) whether by way of salary or otherwise, appearing to the Court to be unfair or unjust to other members of the company.\n\n (3) This section has effect notwithstanding that the offence is one for\n\n15 which the offender is criminally liable.\n\n## Prosecution of delinquent officers and members of company\n\n 241.—(1) If it appears to the Court, in the course of the judicial management or winding up of a company by the Court, that any past or present officer, or any member, of the company has been guilty of\n\n20 an offence in relation to the company for which he or she is criminally\n## liable, the Court may, either on the application of any person interested in the judicial management or winding up (as the case may be) or of its own motion, direct the judicial manager or liquidator to prosecute the offender or to refer the matter to the Minister.\n\n25 (2) If it appears to the judicial manager, in the course of a judicial\n## management, or the liquidator, in the course of a voluntary winding up, that any past or present officer, or any member, of the company has been guilty of any offence in relation to the company for which he or she is criminally liable, the judicial manager or liquidator must\n\n30 immediately report the matter to the Minister and must, in respect of\n## information or documents in the judicial manager’s or liquidator’s possession or under the judicial manager’s or liquidator’s control which relate to the matter in question, furnish the Minister with such information and give to the Minister such access to and facilities for\n\n\n-----\n\n267\n\n## inspecting and taking copies of any document as the Minister may require.\n\n (3) If it appears to the judicial manager, in the course of a judicial management, or the liquidator, in the course of any winding up, that\n the company which is in judicial management or which is being 5 wound up will be unable to pay its unsecured creditors more than 50 cents in the dollar, the judicial manager or liquidator must immediately report the matter in writing to the Official Receiver and must furnish the Official Receiver with such information and give to\n the Official Receiver such access to and facilities for inspecting and 10 taking copies of any document as the Official Receiver may require.\n\n (4) Where any report is made under subsection (2) or (3), the Minister may investigate the matter and for the purposes of such an investigation has all such powers of investigating the affairs of the\n company as are provided by this Act in the case of a winding up by the 15 Court, but if it appears to the Minister that the case is not one in which proceedings ought to be taken by the Minister, the Minister must inform the judicial manager or liquidator (as the case may be) accordingly, and upon being informed, subject to the prior approval of\n the Court, the judicial manager or liquidator (as the case may be) may 20 take proceedings against the offender.\n\n (5) If it appears to the Court, in the course of a judicial management or a voluntary winding up, that any past or present officer, or any member, of the company has been guilty of an offence in relation to\n the company for which he or she is criminally liable and that no report 25 with respect to the matter has been made by the judicial manager or liquidator (as the case may be) to the Minister, the Court may, on the application of any person interested in the judicial management or voluntary winding up or of its own motion, direct the judicial manager\n or liquidator (as the case may be) to make such a report, and on a 30 report being made accordingly this section has effect as though the report has been made under subsection (2).\n\n (6) If, where any matter is reported or referred to the Minister or the Official Receiver under this section, the Minister or the Official\n Receiver (as the case may be) considers that the case is one in which 35 prosecution ought to be instituted, the

otherwise proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the company is unable to pay its debts.\n\n (3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(d), the Court may rely on the\n presence of one or more of the

subsection (2)(a) by\n\n10 substituting a different sum for the sum for the time being specified\n## in that provision.\n\n (6) In this section, “carrying on business” and “to carry on business” have

proceeding may be proceeded with or\n commenced against any contributory of the company in respect of 10 any debt of the company, except by the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes.\n\n Outstanding assets of defunct unregistered company\n\n 249.—(1) Where an unregistered company the place of\n incorporation or origin of which is in a designated country has been 15

entitled; or\n\n (c) over which the company had a disposing power, 20\n\n at the time the company was dissolved, but which was not got in, realised upon or otherwise disposed of or dealt with by the

incorporation or origin of the company.\n\n (2) Where the place of origin of an unregistered company is\n Singapore, sections 212 to 216, with such adaptations as may be 30 necessary, apply in respect of that company.\n\n (3) Where it appears to the Minister that any law in force in any other country contains provisions similar to this section, the Minister\n\n\n-----\n\n278\n\n## may, by notification in the Gazette, declare that other country to be a designated country for the purposes of this section.\n\n Division 2 — Liquidation or dissolution of foreign companies\n\n Liquidation,

The bankruptcy of any person who has been adjudged bankrupt by a bankruptcy order (whether made against the person\n\n15 or against the firm in which the person is a partner) —\n\n## (a) commences on the day the bankruptcy order is made; and\n\n (b) continues until the person is discharged under Part 18.\n\n Effect of bankruptcy order\n\n 327.—(1) On the making of a bankruptcy order —\n\n20 (a) the property of the bankrupt —\n\n## (i) vests in the Official Assignee without any further conveyance, assignment or transfer; and\n\n (ii) becomes divisible among the bankrupt’s creditors;\n\n (b) the Official Assignee is constituted the receiver of the\n\n25 bankrupt’s property; and\n\n## (c) unless otherwise provided by Parts 3 and 13 to 22 —\n\n (i) no creditor to whom the bankrupt is indebted in respect of any debt provable in bankruptcy has any\n\n\n-----\n\n353\n\n## remedy against the person or property of the bankrupt in respect of that debt; and\n\n (ii) no action or proceedings may be proceeded with or commenced against the bankrupt in respect of that\n debt, 5\n\n except by the leave of the Court and in accordance with such terms as the Court may impose.\n\n (2) Where a bankruptcy order is made against a firm, the order operates as if it were a bankruptcy order made against each of the\n persons who, at the time of the order, is a partner in the firm. 10\n\n (3) This section does not affect the right of any secured creditor to realise or otherwise deal with the secured creditor’s security in the same manner as the secured creditor would have been entitled to realise or deal with it if this section had not been enacted.\n\n (4) Despite subsection (3) and section 356, a secured creditor is not 15 entitled to any interest in respect of the secured creditor’s debt after the making of a bankruptcy order unless the secured creditor —\n\n (a) notifies the Official Assignee within 30 days after the date of the bankruptcy order of the secured creditor’s intention\n to claim such interest; and 20\n\n (b) realises the secured creditor’s security within —\n\n (i) 12 months after the date of the bankruptcy order (called in this section the realisation period); or\n\n (ii) such further period as the Official Assignee may\n determine on the application of the secured creditor 25 made at least 30 days (or such shorter period as the Official Assignee may allow) before the expiry of the realisation period.\n\n Restrictions on dispositions of property by bankrupt\n\n 328.—(1) Where a person is adjudged bankrupt, any disposition of 30 property made by the bankrupt during the period beginning on the day of the making of the bankruptcy application and ending on the day of the making of the bankruptcy order is void except to the extent that\n\n\n-----\n\n354\n\n## such disposition has been made with the consent of, or been subsequently ratified by, the Court.\n\n (2) For the purpose of this section, a disposition of property includes any payment (whether in cash or otherwise) made to any person by the\n\n5 bankrupt and accordingly, where any payment is void by virtue of this\n## section, the person to whom the payment was made holds the sum paid for the bankrupt as part of the bankrupt’s estate.\n\n (3) Nothing in this section gives a remedy against any person in respect of —\n\n10 (a) any property or payment which the person received from\n## the bankrupt before the commencement of the bankruptcy in good faith, for value and without notice that the bankruptcy application had been made; or\n\n (b) any interest in property which derives from an interest in\n\n15 respect of which there is, by virtue of this subsection, no\n## remedy.\n\n (4) Where, after the commencement of his or her bankruptcy, the bankrupt has incurred a debt to a banker or any other person by reason of the making of a payment which is void under this section, that debt\n\n20 is deemed for the purposes of Parts 3 and 13 to 22 to have been\n## incurred before the commencement of the bankruptcy unless —\n\n (a) that banker or person had notice of the bankruptcy before the debt was incurred; or\n\n (b) it is not reasonably practicable for the amount of the\n\n25 payment to be recovered from the person to whom it was\n## made.\n\n (5) A disposition of property is void under this section notwithstanding that the property is not or, as the case may be, would not be comprised in the bankrupt’s estate, but nothing in this\n\n30 section affects any disposition made by a person of property held by\n## that person on trust for any other person.\n\n\n-----\n\n355\n\n## Description of bankrupt’s property divisible amongst creditors\n\n 329.—(1) The property of the bankrupt divisible among the bankrupt’s creditors (called in Parts 3 and 13 to 22 the bankrupt’s estate) comprises —\n\n (a) all such property as belongs to or is vested in the bankrupt 5 at the commencement of his or her bankruptcy or is acquired by or devolves on him or her before his or her discharge; and\n\n (b) the capacity to exercise and to take proceedings for\n exercising all such powers in or over or in respect of 10 property as might have been exercised by the bankrupt for his or her own benefit at the commencement of his or her bankruptcy or before his or her discharge.\n\n (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to —\n\n (a) property held by the bankrupt on trust for any other person; 15\n\n (b) such tools, books, vehicles and other items of equipment as are needed by the bankrupt for the bankrupt’s personal use in the bankrupt’s employment, business or vocation;\n\n (c) such clothing, bedding, furniture, household equipment\n and provisions as are necessary for satisfying the basic 20 domestic needs of the bankrupt and the bankrupt’s family;\n\n (d) property of the bankrupt which is excluded under any other written law;\n\n (e) the remainder of the bankrupt’s monthly income after\n deducting the bankrupt’s monthly contribution; and 25\n\n (f) any annual bonus or annual wage supplement paid as part of the bankrupt’s income.\n\n Division 2 — Inquiry into bankrupt’s affairs, dealings and property\n\n Meeting of creditors 30\n\n 330.—(1) The Official Assignee may, at any time after the making of a bankruptcy order, summon a meeting of the bankrupt’s creditors.\n\n\n-----\n\n356\n\n## (2) Despite subsection (1), the Official Assignee must summon a meeting of the bankrupt’s creditors whenever directed by the Court to do so or whenever requested in writing by one-fourth in value of the bankrupt’s creditors to do so.\n\n5 (3) Every meeting summoned under this section must be conducted\n## in accordance with the regulations.\n\n Creditors’ committee\n\n 331.—(1) At any meeting convened by the Official Assignee under section 330(1), the creditors qualified to vote at the meeting, including\n\n10 the holders of general proxies or general powers of attorney from such\n## creditors, may by ordinary resolution appoint from amongst themselves a committee (called in this section the creditors’ committee) of not more than 3 persons for the purpose of advising the Official Assignee on matters relating to the administration of the\n\n15 property of the bankrupt.\n\n## (2) The Official Assignee may convene the creditors’ committee at such times as the Official Assignee thinks necessary, but must convene the committee whenever requested in writing to do so by all or a majority of the members of the committee.\n\n20 (3) Any member of the creditors’ committee may resign from office\n## by notice in writing, signed by the member and delivered to the Official Assignee.\n\n (4) If a member of the creditors’ committee becomes bankrupt, or compounds or arranges with any of the member’s creditors, or is\n\n25 absent from and not represented at 3 consecutive meetings of the\n## committee, the member’s office becomes vacant.\n\n (5) Any member of the creditors’ committee may be removed by an ordinary resolution at any meeting of creditors, of which 7 days’ notice has been given stating the object of the meeting.\n\n30 (6) On a vacancy occurring in the office of a member of the\n## creditors’ committee, the Official Assignee must forthwith summon a meeting of creditors for the purpose of filling the vacancy, and the meeting may by ordinary resolution appoint another creditor or eligible person in subsection (1) to fill the vacancy.\n\n\n-----\n\n357\n\n## (7) In this section, “general powers of attorney” includes lasting powers of attorney registered under the Mental Capacity Act.\n\n Bankrupt’s statement of affairs\n\n 332.—(1) Where a bankruptcy order has been made against an\n individual otherwise than on a debtor’s bankruptcy application, the 5 bankrupt must submit a statement of the bankrupt’s affairs to the Official Assignee within 21 days after the date of the bankruptcy order.\n\n (2) Where a bankruptcy order has been made against a firm —\n\n (a) on a creditor’s bankruptcy application, the bankrupts, being 10 the partners in the firm at the time of the order, must submit a joint statement of their partnership affairs, and each partner in the firm must submit a statement of the partner’s separate affairs;

and\n\n\n-----\n\n405\n\n## (b) discharges the Official Assignee from all personal liability in respect of that property as from the commencement of the Official Assignee’s trusteeship,\n\n but does not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing\n the bankrupt, the bankrupt’s estate and the Official Assignee from any 5 liability, affect the rights and liabilities of any other person.\n\n (4) A notice of disclaimer may not be given under subsection (1) in respect of any property —\n\n (a) in the case of property subject to any written law set out in\n the first column of the Second Schedule, unless — 10\n\n (i) the Official Assignee has given written notice of the Official Assignee’s intention to disclaim the property, to the relevant person set out opposite in the second column; and\n\n (ii) a period of 28 days starting on the date of the notice 15 mentioned in sub‑paragraph (i) has elapsed; or\n\n (b) in any case, if —\n\n (i) a person interested in the property has applied in writing to the Official Assignee or one of the Official\n Assignee’s predecessors as trustee requiring the 20 Official Assignee or that predecessor to decide whether or not the Official Assignee or that predecessor will disclaim the property; and\n\n (ii) the notice of disclaimer is not given under this section\n in respect of that property within a period of 28 days, 25 or such longer period as the Court may allow, starting on the date of the application mentioned in sub‑paragraph (i).\n\n (5) The Official Assignee is deemed to have adopted any contract\n which by virtue of this section the Official Assignee is not entitled to 30 disclaim.\n\n (6) Any person sustaining loss or damage in consequence of the operation of a disclaimer under this section is deemed to be a creditor\n\n\n-----\n\n406\n\n## of the bankrupt to the extent of the loss or damage and accordingly may prove for the loss or damage as a bankruptcy debt.\n\n Disclaimer of leaseholds\n\n 374.—(1) A disclaimer under section 373 of any property of a\n\n5 leasehold nature does not take effect unless a copy of the notice of\n## disclaimer has been served (so far as the Official Assignee is aware of their addresses) on every person claiming under the bankrupt as sub‑lessee or mortgagee and either —\n\n (a) no application under section 375 is made with respect to the\n\n10 property before the end of the period of 14 days starting on\n## the date on which the last notice served under this subsection was served; or\n\n (b) where an application under section 375 has been made, the Court directs that the disclaimer is to take effect.\n\n15 (2) Where the Court gives a direction under subsection (1)(b), the\n## Court may also, instead of or in addition to any order the Court makes under section 375, make such orders with respect to fixtures, tenant’s improvements and other matters arising out of lease as the Court thinks fit.\n\n20 Court order vesting disclaimed property\n\n## 375.—(1) This section and section 376 apply where the Official Assignee has disclaimed property under section 373.\n\n (2) An application may be made to the Court under this section by —\n\n25 (a) any person who claims an interest in the disclaimed\n## property;\n\n (b) any person who is under any liability in respect of the disclaimed property, not being a liability discharged by the disclaimer;

— 25\n\n (a) informing the creditors that the Official Assignee is satisfied that the relevant condition is met;\n\n (b) informing the creditors that they may wish to consider making an application under section 36 for the appointment\n of a person other than the Official Assignee to act as the 30 trustee of the bankrupt’s estate; and\n\n (c) providing a summary of the administration of the bankrupt’s estate that contains such particulars as may be prescribed.\n\n\n-----\n\n414\n\n## (3) Nothing in this section relieves the Official Assignee of any obligation under section 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344 or 347.\n\n (4) In this section —\n\n “institutional creditor” has the meaning given by section 36(4),\n\n5 except that the reference, in paragraph (d)(ii) of the definition\n## of “institutional creditor” in that section, to the date of the application for the bankruptcy order mentioned in section 36(2) is to be read as a reference to the date of the bankruptcy application on which the bankrupt was adjudged\n\n10 bankrupt;\n\n## “relevant condition” means a majority in value of the total debts of the bankrupt that have been proved (and are not withdrawn) are owed to one or more persons who are either an institutional creditor or a subsidiary of an institutional\n\n15 creditor.\n\n## Division 8 — Distribution of property\n\n Distribution by means of dividend\n\n 385.—(1) Whenever the Official Assignee has sufficient funds in hand for the purpose, the Official Assignee must, subject to the\n\n20 retention of such sums as may be necessary for the expenses of the\n## bankruptcy, declare and distribute dividends among the creditors in respect of the debts which the creditors have respectively proved.\n\n (2) The Official Assignee must give notice of the Official Assignee’s intention to declare and distribute a dividend.\n\n25 (3) Where the Official Assignee has declared a dividend, the Official\n## Assignee must give notice of the dividend and of how the Official Assignee proposes to distribute it.\n\n (4) The notice given under subsection (3) must contain the prescribed particulars of the bankrupt’s estate.\n\n30 (5) In the calculation and distribution of a dividend, the Official\n## Assignee must make provision —\n\n (a) for any provable debt which is the subject of any claim which has not yet been determined; and\n\n\n-----\n\n415\n\n## (b) for disputed proofs and claims.\n\n (6) No dividend is to be paid to any creditor which does not amount to $50.\n\n Claims by unsatisfied creditors\n\n 386.—(1) A creditor who has not proved the creditor’s debt before 5 the declaration of any dividend is not entitled to disturb, by reason that the creditor has not participated in it, the distribution of that dividend or any other dividend declared before the debt was proved.\n\n (2) When a creditor has proved the creditor’s debt, the creditor is\n entitled to be paid out of any money for the time being available for 10 the payment of any further dividend, any dividend or dividends which the creditor has failed to receive.\n\n (3) Any dividend or dividends payable under subsection (2) must be paid before that money is applied to the payment of any such further\n dividend. 15\n\n Final distribution\n\n 387.—(1) When the Official Assignee has realised all the bankrupt’s estate or so much of it as can, in the opinion of the Official Assignee, be realised without needlessly protracting the proceedings in\n bankruptcy, the Official Assignee may give notice in the prescribed 20 manner of the Official Assignee’s intention to declare a final dividend.\n\n (2) The notice under subsection (1) must contain the prescribed particulars and must require claims against the bankrupt’s estate to be established by a date (called in this section the final date) specified in\n the notice. 25\n\n (3) The Court may, on the application of any person, postpone the final date.\n\n (4) After the final date, the Official Assignee must —\n\n (a) defray any outstanding expenses of the bankruptcy out of\n the bankrupt’s estate; and 30\n\n (b) if the Official Assignee intends to declare a final dividend, declare and distribute that dividend without regard to the\n\n\n-----\n\n416\n\n## claim of any person in respect of a debt not already proved in the bankruptcy.\n\n Joint and separate dividends\n\n 388.—(1) Where one partner of a firm is adjudged bankrupt, a\n\n5 creditor to whom the bankrupt is indebted jointly with the other\n## partners of the firm, or any of them, is not entitled to receive any dividend out of the separate property of the bankrupt until all the separate creditors have received the full amount of their respective debts.\n\n10 (2) Where joint and separate properties are being administered,\n## dividends of the joint and separate properties are, subject to any order to the contrary that is made by the Court on the application of the Official Assignee or any person interested, to be declared together.\n\n (3) The expenses of and incidental to the dividends are to be fairly\n\n15 apportioned by the Official Assignee between the joint and separate\n## properties, regard being had to the work done for and the benefit received by each property.\n\n No action for dividend\n\n 389.—(1) No action for a dividend lies against the Official\n\n20 Assignee.\n\n## (2) If the Official Assignee refuses to pay any dividend, the Court may, if it thinks fit, order the Official Assignee to pay the dividend, and also to pay out of the Consolidated Fund interest on the dividend for the period that it is withheld and the costs of the application to the\n\n25 Court.\n\n## Payment of interest exceeding what is allowed under section 356 out of surplus\n\n 390.—(1) Where any amount remains after the debts and expenses of the bankruptcy have been paid (called in this section the surplus),\n\n30 the interest mentioned in subsection (2) must be paid before the\n## bankrupt is entitled under section 391 to any of the surplus.\n\n (2) The surplus is to be paid towards interest on each debt proved in bankruptcy, from (and including) the day after the date of the\n\n\n-----\n\n417\n\n## bankruptcy order to (and including) the date that debt was paid, calculated at such rate of interest as the creditor may be entitled under an agreement or, in the absence of any such agreement, at such rate as may be prescribed.\n\n (3) For the purposes of subsection (2) — 5\n\n (a) interest on preferential debts ranks equally with interest on other debts;\n\n (b) interest of the same class ranks equally between themselves; and\n\n (c) if the surplus is insufficient to pay all interest of the same 10 class, the interest in that class is to abate in equal proportions between themselves.\n\n Right of bankrupt to surplus\n\n 391.—(1) The bankrupt is entitled to any surplus remaining after\n payment in full of the bankrupt’s creditors, with interest as provided 15 by Parts 3 and 13 to 22, and of the costs, charges and expenses of the proceedings under the bankruptcy application.\n\n (2) Despite subsection (1), the Court may make an order directing the Official Assignee not to pay the surplus or part of the surplus to the\n bankrupt if — 20\n\n (a) the Attorney-General applies for an order under this section; and\n\n (b) the Court is satisfied that —\n\n (i) proceedings under any written law dealing with\n confiscation of the proceeds of crime are pending; 25 and\n\n (ii) the property of the bankrupt may become subject to a confiscation order or be required to meet some other order made on those proceedings.\n\n (3) The Court may, on an application, vary or revoke an order made 30 under subsection (2).\n\n\n-----\n\n418\n\n## PART 18\n\n ANNULMENT AND DISCHARGE\n\n Court’s power to annul bankruptcy order\n\n 392.—(1) The Court may annul a bankruptcy order if it appears to\n\n5 the Court that

PROVISIONS\n\n Administration in bankruptcy of estate of person dying insolvent\n\n30 419.—(1) In this section, unless the context otherwise requires,\n## “creditor” means one or more creditors qualified to make a bankruptcy application under Part 16.\n\n\n-----\n\n445\n\n## (2) The Official Assignee or any creditor of a deceased debtor whose debt would have been sufficient to support a bankruptcy application against the debtor had the debtor been alive, may make to the Court an application for an order for the administration of the\n estate of the deceased debtor according to Parts 16 to 21. 5\n\n (3) Every application under this section is to be in the same form as a creditor’s bankruptcy application under section 307, with such variations as the case may require, except that in the case of an application by the Official Assignee, it is not necessary to allege or\n prove that any debt is owing to the applicant. 10\n\n (4) Upon the prescribed notice being given to the legal representative, if any, of the deceased debtor, the Court may, in the prescribed manner, upon proof of the applicant’s debt, unless the Court is satisfied that there is a reasonable probability that the estate\n will be sufficient for the payment of the debts owing by the deceased 15 debtor, make an order for the administration in bankruptcy of the deceased debtor’s estate, or may, upon cause being shown, dismiss the application with or without costs.\n\n (5) An application for administration under this section must not be\n made to the Court after proceedings have been commenced for the 20 administration of the deceased debtor’s estate, except that the Court may, in that case, on the application of any creditor and on proof that the estate is insufficient to pay its debts in the prescribed manner, make an order for the administration of the estate of the deceased\n debtor in bankruptcy, and the like consequences ensue as under an 25 administration order made on the application of a creditor.\n\n (6) An administration order under this section must not be made until the expiration of 2 months after the date of the grant of probate or letters of administration, unless with the concurrence of the legal\n representative of the deceased debtor. 30\n\n (7) Upon an administration order being made under this section, the property of the debtor vests in the

with Parts 16 to 21. 35\n\n\n-----\n\n446\n\n## (8) Sections 334, 335 and 336 so far as they relate to persons other than the debtor, and, with the modifications under this section, all the provisions of Part 17, so far as the same are applicable, apply to the case of an administration order under this section, and for the purposes\n\n5 of such application, unless the context otherwise requires, every\n## reference to a bankrupt is to be read as a reference to the legal representative of the deceased debtor.\n\n (9) Sections 361, 367 and 368 apply in the case of an administration order under this section as if the administration order were a\n\n10 bankruptcy order.\n\n## (10) In the administration of the property of the deceased debtor under an administration order, the Official Assignee must have regard to any claims by the legal representative of the deceased debtor to payment of the proper funeral and testamentary expenses incurred by\n\n15 the legal representative in and about the debtor’s estate, and such\n## claims are deemed to be preferential debts under the administration order and are payable in full out of the debtor’s estate in priority to all other debts.\n\n (11) If on the administration of a deceased debtor’s estate any\n\n20 surplus remains in the hands of the Official Assignee after payment in\n## full of all the debts due from the debtor, together with the costs of the administration and interest as provided by Parts 16 to 21 in the case of a bankruptcy, the surplus is, subject to section 391(2), to be paid over to the legal representative of the deceased debtor’s estate or dealt with\n\n25 in such other manner as is prescribed.\n\n## (12) Upon notice being given to the legal representative of a deceased debtor of the making by a creditor of an application under this section, and in the event of an administration order being made on the application, no payment or transfer of property made by the legal\n\n30 representative after the giving of the notice operates as a discharge to\n## the legal representative as between the legal representative and the Official Assignee.\n\n (13) Subject to this section, nothing in this section invalidates any payment made or act or thing done in good faith by the legal\n\n35 representative before the date of the administration order.\n\n\n-----\n\n447\n\n## Arbitration agreements to which bankrupt is party\n\n 420.—(1) This section applies where a bankrupt had become party to a contract containing an arbitration agreement before the commencement of his or her bankruptcy.\n\n (2) If the Official Assignee adopts the contract, the arbitration 5 agreement is enforceable by or against the Official Assignee in relation to matters arising from or connected with the contract.\n\n (3) If the Official Assignee does not adopt the contract and a matter to which the arbitration agreement applies requires to be determined in\n connection with or for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings — 10\n\n (a) the Official Assignee; or\n\n (b) any other party to the agreement,\n\n may apply to the Court which may, if the Court thinks fit in all the circumstances of the case, order that the matter be referred to\n arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement. 15\n\n Costs\n\n 421.—(1) No payment may, without the approval of the Official Assignee, be allowed in the accounts of any trustee in bankruptcy or of any special manager in respect of the performance by any other person\n of the ordinary duties which are required by Parts 3 and 13 to 22 or the 20 regulations to be performed by the trustee in bankruptcy or special manager, as the case may be.\n\n (2) Unless agreed to by the Official Assignee, all bills and charges of any solicitor, manager, accountant, auctioneer, broker and other\n person (each called in this section a billing person) must be taxed by 25 the Court.\n\n (3) Every billing person must, on request by the Official Assignee, which request the Official Assignee must make a sufficient time before declaring a dividend, deliver the billing person’s bill of costs or\n charges for taxation by the Court. 30\n\n (4) If the billing person fails to deliver the bill of costs or charges for taxation by the Court within 7 days after receipt of the request mentioned in subsection (3), or such further time as the Court on\n\n\n-----\n\n448\n\n## application grants, the Official Assignee must declare and distribute the dividend without regard to any claim by the billing person, and after such declaration and distribution, any such claim is forfeited as against the Official Assignee personally and as against the estate.\n\n5 Actions by Official Assignee and bankrupt’s partners\n\n## 422.—(1) Where a

commence the action or proceeding must be given to the bankrupt’s partner and the partner may show cause against it, and on the partner’s application the Court\n\n15 may, if the Court thinks fit, direct that the partner is to receive the\n## partner’s proper share of the proceeds of the action or proceeding, and if the partner does not claim any benefit from the proceeds of the action or proceeding, the partner is to be indemnified against costs in respect of the action or proceeding as the Court directs.\n\n20 Action in aid of courts of Malaysia and designated countries\n\n## 423.—(1) The Court and the officers of the Court must, in all matters of bankruptcy and insolvency, act in aid of and be auxiliary to the courts of Malaysia or any designated country having jurisdiction in bankruptcy and insolvency so long as the law of Malaysia or the\n\n25 designated country requires its courts to act in aid of and be auxiliary\n## to the courts of Singapore.\n\n (2) An order of any such court of Malaysia or any designated country, seeking aid with a request to the Court, is deemed sufficient to enable the Court to exercise in respect of the matters directed by the\n\n30 order such jurisdiction as either the court which made the request or\n## the Court could exercise in respect of similar matters within their several jurisdictions.\n\n\n-----\n\n449\n\n## (3) In this section, “designated country” means any country designated for the purposes of this section by the Minister by notification in the Gazette.\n\n Reciprocal recognition of Official Assignees\n\n 424.—(1) The Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, declare 5 that the Government of Singapore has entered into an agreement with the government of Malaysia for the recognition by

Malaysia, such property of the bankrupt situate in Singapore as would, if the bankrupt had been adjudged bankrupt in Singapore, vest in the Official Assignee of Singapore, vests in the Official Assignee appointed by the\n government of Malaysia, and all courts in Singapore must 15 recognise the title of such Official Assignee to such property.\n\n (3) Subsection (2) does not apply where a bankruptcy application has been made against the bankrupt in Singapore until the application has been dismissed or withdrawn or the bankruptcy order has been\n rescinded or annulled. 20\n\n (4) The production of an order of adjudication purporting to be certified, under the seal of the court in Malaysia making the order, by the registrar of that court, or of a copy of the official Gazette of Malaysia containing a notice of an order adjudging a person a\n bankrupt is conclusive proof in all courts in Singapore of the order 25 having been duly made and of its date.\n\n (5) The Official Assignee of Malaysia may sue and be sued in any court in Singapore by the official name of “the Official Assignee of the Property of (name of bankrupt), a Bankrupt under the Law of\n Malaysia”. 30\n\n

Where the Official Assignee provides a service to the public by which computerised information of prescribed particulars of a bankrupt is supplied to the public on payment of a prescribed fee,\n\n30 neither the Government nor any of its employees involved in the\n## supply of such information is liable for any loss or damage suffered by any member of the public or the bankrupt by reason of any error or omission of any nature in the information, regardless of how the error\n\n\n-----\n\n453\n\n## or omission is caused, if the provision of the information containing the error or omission is made in good faith and in the ordinary course of the discharge of the duties of the employee.\n\n List of undischarged bankrupts, etc., to be kept\n\n 433.—(1) The Official Assignee must maintain, in such form or 5 manner as the Official Assignee thinks fit —\n\n (a) a list of undischarged bankrupts;\n\n (b) a list of discharged bankrupts;\n\n (c) a record of every bankruptcy order;\n\n (d) a record of every order rescinding a bankruptcy order;

The powers include the power to require any licensee to provide any\ndocument or information specified in a written notice. The clause makes it an\noffence to fail to comply with the requirement imposed on the person by the\nlicensing officer, but it is a defence to a charge of failing to produce a document if\nthe person proves that the document was not in the person’s possession or control,\nand the person had a reasonable excuse for failing to comply with the requirement.\n\n\n-----\n\n568\n\nClause 58 confers on the licensing officer the power to issue written directions if\nthe licensing officer thinks it necessary or expedient for the purposes of\nadministration of Division 3 of Part 3.
